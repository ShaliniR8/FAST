                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="We were parked at North Cargo 3 (BOS) undergoing servicing of the aircraft at the time of the event. 
Passengers had been deplaned, equipment offloaded, and the aircraft fueled. A request was made to have 
the lavs fully dumped to facilitate the winterization process as we were scheduled to fly to YYZ for an 
overnight. At 7:15, I was in the back of the airplane with several of my flight attendants when we felt 
something impact the aircraft. There was a loud bang as the plane shook wildly for several seconds 
accompanied by sounds of screeching metal. I immediately ran off the airplane down the stairs on to the 
tarmac. Seeing nothing to the left, I ran around the front of the aircraft to the right side where I saw a body 
sprawled out on the ground behind the right engine &amp; Hector Ortega (Mech) running towards Pat Marz (Co 
Rep) and myself screaming for someone to call 911. I raced back up the stairs to the aircraft. At 7:16 I 
placed a call to 911 and instructed F/O De LaRosa to call ground control and relay situation to MassPort 
and instructed everyone else to remain onboard. Police, Fire/Rescue, Paramedics et al arrived on scene a 
couple minutes later."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="While I can only speculate, what I think happened is this. One Signature employee was backing a lavatory 
service truck into position on aircraft left as another man was marshalling him in. The driver may have left 
the vehicle in Reverse thinking in fact he had put it in Park. Attempting to get out of the truck and with it still 
moving, he probably panicked and accidentally slammed on the gas pedal, instantly ramming into the 
marshaller, the tail end of the aircraft and out the other side coming to a rest about 30-40 feet off to aircraft 
right. On a side note, I do not recall seeing extra wheel chocks lying on the ground near where the lavatory 
truck should have been had it been parked properly."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="The following report was submitted to me by one of our reps in EWR, Jeff Gray,  who was the assigned GSC for this departure:

[Jeff wrote:] &quot;On a different topic, I want to bring something to your attention regarding LL330/27Nov EWR-RDU that I'm sure you'll know who should be advised of it at MAI. After my GSC duties on this flight at the Signature FBO at Newark, I of course stayed and assisted with the flight until taxi. AFTER the cabin door was closed and the stairs were about to be pulled, one of the ASIG ground staff that had been loading bags onto the aircraft, casually mentioned to me that they had loaded a &quot;few more&quot; bags in the aft compartment than we had originally planned for. I asked if he had advised the Captain of this and when he responded no I immediately asked how many more bags were loaded. He said that 70 bags were loaded in the aft compartment when we had been expecting only 40. On a light flight like this one, 30 extra bags may not sound like a tremendous issue but I know that any increase or decrease in cargo load should always and without fail, be reported to the flight deck. In this case, I had been standing next to the Captain when he advised this same guy to put the 40 bags in the aft hold and advise him (the Captain) if there were more. I had the airstairs kept at the A/C door and went up to tell the Captain of the increase; he advised me that no bag movements were needed and the additional bags loaded aft could be left there. He also wanted to know why he wasn't advised of this before the weight and balance paperwork was completed. While I realize this doesn't fall under the duties of the GSC, I know enough about airline operations and weight/balance to know that this failure of communication to the cockpit could have potentially devestating results so I felt I needed to call attention to it at MAI HDQ. 
 
I can be reached for any additional information or comments once this message gets into the proper hands.
 
Thanks and regards,
Jeff

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="My duty time started at 13:30 (ELP time)/ 15:30 (Miami time) when Maintenance Control told me the issue 
about 739 flying without a Preflight Transit being done.(12-29-30)
From that time on I was preparing myself to work on the PT and the other issue of the APU being on DMI.
The times are recorded in Maintenance Control (both shift), Hotel, and Cutter Aviation.  I came back to the 
hotel and I only had time to take a shower and get ready for show time at 12:30 (ELP time).
After I got the PT performed (2.50 hours), I started working on the troubleshooting of the APU (2.0 hours). I 
was my initiative to work on the DMI. 
When I was finished, I called Maintenance Control and gave the results of the TS being the APU ECU the 
possible defective unit. I told him that it could be an intermittent problem when I initially interrogated the FMC 
CDU recent faults of APU showed no defects at this time.
The DOM &amp; Maintenance Controllers were involved since I wrote an email early explaining that m
At that time (21:30 ELP time), I was told to change the IGV actuator since this problem could be an 
intermittent one.
When I was replacing the unit, I noticed that the six o-rings that came with the shipment were all the same. 
Each fuel line required 2 different o-rings. As per the AMM, once you take off the line you must replace the o-
ring. Since all the o-rings shipped to me were different in size, I had no choice to call Maintenance Control 
and DMI the APU completely. This means that each leg the AC needs to use electrical &amp; air power at each 
station.
Let me clarify this: the order of o-rings was incomplete. Because of it, I encounter another problem when I 
removed the fuel lines from its original position and was that I need to have an identical new o-ring replaced 
in which I did not have. I had to DMI APU completely.

The duty time ended at SFB (12-30-13) when I had total of more than 22 hours. I did not rest at the hotel in 
between times because there was no time for it since I was working. When I arrive to SFB, I called 
Maintenance Control to let them know my status of fatigue. Let me clarify this: I was fatigued and I have 
nothing more to demonstrate the effort to stay alert, conscious, safe, and awake for a period of 22 hours. Not 
only that, I had in front of me another 5 other hours of flying and complete the APU DMI issue. We are talking 
about over 35 hours easily knowing the AC was running late.

DOM &amp; Maintenance Control knew of this issue since I wrote an email early on 12-27-13 telling about my 
duty time of 16 hours by the time I get to PHX. Then the duty time will increase when I begin to work the APU 
DMI.
I told the Captain Tom Osullivan about the issue at the gate in SFB, I did not want to leave without explaining 
my situation and why I was calling fatigued."></attribute>

The foreman questioned the pilot if there was a problem with the pump. The pilot told the foreman he shut it down so that the towbar could be attached to the AC without the worry of hydraulic pressure damaging the towbar or personnel. The foreman had just come out of the 737 Fam class and was aware that shutting down the engine driven pump damages the solonoid, but as he is a new foreman here, he waited till the pilot left then turned on the pump and asked me about it this morning."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Part 91 ferry from KPIT to KBWI.  Clear, moonlit night w/ unrestricted visibility.  Fuel on board was 3.6 Kilos.  Approaching COLUM (approximately 10 
miles from Runway 10) on ILS RWY 10 at BWI, an unspecified/undetermined electrical system malfunction occurred that led to an unsafe landing 
gear indication in addition to various other system warnings, cautions and failures.  The red &quot;Nose Gear&quot; landing gear indication was illuminated 
when the gear handle was placed in the down position.  No other landing gear indication was illuminated (either red or green) with the gear handle 
in the down position.  The aircraft sounded and flew as if the landing gear had been successfully deployed, but a go around was initiated to look 
into the problem.  An emergency was declared and observers on the ground at BWI were asked to attempt to determine the landing gear position if 
possible.  Several low approaches were flown and the observers on the ground noted the taxi light was on (demonstrating that the nose gear had 
deployed), and it was believed that, in fact, all the landing gear had deployed.  There was no locked indication, however.  With no indications of any 
failure of the hydraulic system or landing gear system, and all concurrent malfunctions were electrical in nature, which would not affect the 
deployment and subsequent locking of the landing gear, the aircraft was flown to an uneventful and successful landing on RWY 10 at BWI.  The 
aircraft taxied to parking under its own power.  Aircraft shut down with 2.5 Kilos. fuel on board.  BWI airport authorities met the aircraft at the parking 
stand and asked whether there were any further problems and whether any further assistance was required.  No further assistance was required."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="All procedures were performed in accordance with all applicable Operations and Flight Manuals.  The electrical malfunction that occurred was the subject of 
several days of troubleshooting and consultation with the aircraft manufacturer as well as other 737-400 operators.  As of this writing, an exact description of 
the failure has not been determined, nor has the aircraft flown since the subject incident flight.  In addition to the unsafe gear indications as described above, 
the following observations were made in the 20 minutes or so prior to landing the aircraft at BWI:

Caution Lights Illuminated:

Both &quot;Pack&quot; Lights (Air conditioning system went into full cold and high flow)
All &quot;Zone Temp&quot; Lights
&quot;Speedbrake Do Not Arm&quot; Light
&quot;Speed Trim Fail&quot;
&quot;Mach Trim Fail&quot;
&quot;Auto Slat Fail&quot;

Other things that did not work:

FO's artificial horizon (tube went blank)
Standby Gyro tumbled and displayed all three &quot;off&quot; flags
N1 and fuel flow indications went blank
Oxygen indication went to zero
Autopilot disconnect aural warning was inoperative
Cabin call button was inoperative
Intercom was inoperative
Only one thrust-reverser deployed after landing

Things that did work:

Autopilot
Autothrottle
FMC
MCP
ILS and communication radios

Due to the short time from the malfunction occurrence to landing, there may have been other inoperative systems as well, but landing the aircraft safely was a 
higher priority than in-flight troubleshooting."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="avoiding_recurrence_of_this_event" value="While no one can predict when or why such a bizarre electrical system malfunction will occur, it should be noted that nothing in the QRH or other 
onboard manuals would be of great assistance due to the nature of the malfunction(s) presented on this flight.  Most of the emergencies we train 
to are canned and their resolutions readily available via the QRH and other manuals.  Some emergencies require an acceptance of whatever is 
presented and the priority remains flying the aircraft and landing it safely as soon as possible.  Had the flight been in IFR / bad weather 
conditions, or had been at another phase of flight (en-route at altitude and far from a suitable landing field), the result may have been totally 
different."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Prior to the duty day in question, I attempted to adjust my sleep schedule however, as I mentioned above, 
it is hard to force your body and brain to go to sleep when they don't want to.  Also, both the Captain and I 
planned to nap during our ground stops in KDTW and KTPA but, we couldn't accomplish our rest goals 
due to all the activities around the aircraft, i.e. catering, fueling, aircraft loading, and other flight related 
duties and responsibilities.  The Captain and I started to show signs of fatigue on our KDTW - KTPA leg.  
During the descend into KTPA we were both randomly yawning and head drooping.  Once on the ground, 
we attempted to depart KTPA ahead of schedule but a 07:00 am (local) landing curfew in KFRG put a 
stop to our plans.  We had to wait in KTPA for at least 2 hours before we could depart in order to comply 
with the landing curfew.  As previously mentioned, attempts were made to nap but catering, aircraft 
unloading, and cleaning prevented us from doing so.  We were able to catch a nap of 30 minutes prior to 
our departure however, I think this made things worse.  In preparation for our KTPA - KFRG leg, I noticed 
that both the Captain and I were slow, constantly yawning, and we were having difficulties completing 
simple tasks like reading the checklist and programing the FMC.  Also, we had some additional duties to 
perform like arming the doors and inspecting the galleys since our Flight Attendants were not scheduled 
to ferry the airplane with us to KFRG.  Instead, they got limoed to Miami.  Right after take-off both the 
Captain and I showed all the mental and physical symptoms of fatigue.  In addition to those, we were 
having problems completing simple tasks like radio communications and fuel checks.  As a precaution, we 
both decided to keep all cockpit lights on, take constant walks, set alarm clocks, breathe oxygen, and 
position our seats in uncomfortable positions so we could stay awake.  During the final stage of the flight, 
our fatigue was such that my Captain spoke to me in his native language (Dutch) several times without 
noticing.  Thankfully, we completed the flight without incident.  Once we were out of the airplane, we took 
a taxi to LGA in the middle of the morning rush hour.  We finally got to our hotel in LGA at around 9:00 am 
(local) and I believe our duty exceeded 16 hours.  I attempted to fill out a report when I got to the hotel 
however, I was so tired that I fell sleep the moment I sat on my bed, while wearing my entire uniform, 
including my shoes.  I woke up about 8 hours later and stayed awake long enough to take my uniform and 
my shoes off, get a quick bite to eat.  I went right back to sleep after my meal so I could catch my 
commercial flight home."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="As per the CBA and our company policies, Miami Air is suppose to recognize that certain types of flying 
can, in certain circumstances, be a factor in causing fatigue (i.e. nighttime or â€œback side of the clockâ€ 
flying) and will bear this in mind when constructing trip sequences.  With all the options available to the 
company, I strongly believe Miami Air failed to follow the above statement and created a unsafe and 
fatigue inducing paring.  Also, even though fatigue affected our judgement, we (the pilots) failed to 
recognize all the &quot;red flags&quot;.  In retrospect, we should have both called fatigue in KTPA and delayed the 
flight until we were both properly rested."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="The previous duty day ended at 0045 local time, Tried to stay up as long as possible and went to bed 
around 3 am, woke up at around 10:30 am, for a report time of 17:00 local. For a scheduled duty day off 
15 hours. 
Flew first leg from KLGA to KDTW, where we were on the ground for 3 hours 25 minutes, tried to take a 
nap, but with all the activities in and around the aircraft was unable to do so.
2nd leg, from KDTW to KTPA, aircraft on ground for 2 hours, got in about a 30 minute nap.
3rd leg, from KTPA to KFRG, Both the First Officer and myself were yawning throughout the flight.
From KFRG we took a Taxi to the hotel next to KLGA, Due to traffic this took one and a half hours, But 
as soon as I was in the Taxi I was so tired I fell asleep and slept the whole time.
Had lunch with the First Officer later that day, and he told me I had spoken to him in Dutch (my native 
language) several times during the flight, of which I have no recollection whatsoever."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="Our Duty day was scheduled for 15 hours, with 7 hours and 15 minutes of flying. Unfortunately the 
previous 3 days had ended between midnight and 2 am, And this day starting at 17:00 lcl, requiring a 
much different sleep schedule. The schedule called for two extended ground stops, Which I believe made 
the situation much worse. 
To avoid this situation in future, Either and an extra pilot, So that one can rest on the plane when tired or 
limit the duty day/ flight sectors."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="I was being transported by MG Bus Service on 4/1/12 after completing screening for LL 618. The driver (Did not get his name) almost ran a stop sign because he was going at a high speed. We advised him to slow down and be careful! He continued to drive recklessly on I95 Southbound. He was swerving out of his lane causing cars to honk their horns at him. We continuously told him to slow down and be careful; he responded with giggles. 

This is the 2nd bad experience that I have had with this company. The first experience was in November after completing screening at Landmark Aviation for ETA Logistics. It was raining outside; the driver was speeding because he had other clients to pick up. I told him to slow down to prevent my death. He yelled back at me saying he needed to pick someone else up! I arrived at MAI the following night to discover MG was our mode of transportation. I told Joe and Anthony of my decision to NEVER ride in that companies vehicle's and proceeded to drive my own to Landmark. 

I would have driven my car on 4/1 had I known MG was picking us up from Shelt Air! My safety should not be questioned when on duty for Miami Air! I will no longer subject myself to the torture of riding in another MG vehicle.

During Flight Segment 3 (TUL to COS) I believe I may have become fatigued due to the long duty day combined as Split Duty without an intervening required rest period and due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.


FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on 21MAR12 thru 22MAR12

FAR 117.21 Reserve status

For Reference Section (a) states:

Section (a) Unless specifically designated as airport/standby or short-call reserve by
the certificate holder, all reserve is considered long-call reserve.

Limitations exceeded:


Section (d) For long call reserve, if a certificate holder contacts a flight crew member
to assign him or her to a flight duty period that will begin before and operate into the
flight crew memberâ€™s window of circadian low, the flight crew member must receive a
12 hour notice of report time from the certificate holder.

Section (e) A certificate holder may shift a reserve flight crew memberâ€™s reserve status
from long-call to short-call only if the flight crew member receives a rest period as
provided in Â§ 117.25(e).

FAR 117.25 Rest period.
Section (e) No certificate holder may schedule and no flight crew member may accept an assignment for any reserve or flight duty period unless the flight crew member is given a rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours immediately before beginning the reserve or flight duty period measured from the time the flight crew member is released from duty. The 10 hour rest period must provide the flight crew member with a minimum of 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep opportunity.

FAR 117.15 Split Duty.
Section (d) The rest opportunity that the flight crew member is actually provided may
not be less than the rest opportunity that was scheduled.

Section (f) The combined time of the flight duty period and the rest opportunity
provided in this section does not exceed 14 hours.

IN SPECIFIC

Violation of 117.21 section (d) occurred at (U2) report time of 0500L / 1200z (22MAR12) for not providing a 12 hour notice of report time before beginning the flight duty period that began before and operated into the
flight crew memberâ€™s window of circadian low.


Violation of 117.21 section (e) occurred at (U2) Skeds notification time of 2205L (21MAR12) / 0505z (22MAR12) for shifting a reserve flight crew memberâ€™s reserve status from long-call to short-call without granting the flight crew member a rest period as provided in Â§ 117.25(e). In essence, I received 6+55 hrs of uninterrupted rest.


Violation of 117.25 section (e) occurred at (U2) Skeds notification time of 2205L (21MAR12) / 0505z (22MAR12) for not providing the flight crew member with a minimum of 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep opportunity. Also, [Â§ 117.25(e) affords the flight crew member a rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours immediately before beginning the reserve or flight duty period. As such the company stood in violation of section (e) at (U2) report time of 0500L / 1200z (22MAR12) for not providing a 10 hour consecutive rest period.] Existing rest filed by the company was given after the fact by default, no true required rest period in accordance with FAR 117 and FAR 121 was accomplished.


Violation of 117.15 section (d) occurred at (U2) Skeds notification time of 2205L (21MAR12) / 0505z (22MAR12) for attempting to classify the FDPâ€™s as Split duty when the rest opportunity provided in PHX was less than the rest opportunity scheduled and thus did not qualify as Spit duty.


Violation of 117.15 section (f) occurred at (U2) Skeds notification time of 2205L (21MAR12) / 0505z (22MAR12) for rescheduling both FDPâ€™s together as Split duty in excess of 14 hours combined rest opportunity and flight duty period.

[The total number of hours I spent in this flight duty period and on long call reserve adjusted to short call out with follow up FDP totaled 22+40 hours. &lt;End of FDP time 1605L / 2205z (22MAR12) minus start of duty 21MAR12 1545L / 2045z (21MAR12)&gt;


Please Note
As a reference towards the progress of Miami Air complying with FAR 117
I would like to include the following:

Beginning in January of 2012 under the new unenforceable regulation FAR 117, I have now completed 17  FDPâ€™s (Flighty Duty Periods) as a pilot in flight.

Of the 17 FDPâ€™s thus far 8 of them have exceeded limitations as established in FAR 117.

During Flight Segment 3 (AUA to SKB) I believe I may have become fatigued due to the long duty day and due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.

FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on 01MAR12.

FAR 117.11 Flight Time Limitation.
Table A
Scheduled Time of Start (0430L)
MAX FLIGHT TIME LIMIT = 8+00

8+25 scheduled FLIGHT TIME exceeded this limitation; 8+35 Actual FLIGHT TIME exceeded this limitation

FAR 117.13 Flight Duty Period: Unaugmented operations
Table B
Scheduled Time of Start (0430L)
Number of Flight Segments (3)

MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 10+00
11+25 scheduled FDP exceeded this limitation; 11+15 Actual FDP exceeded this limitation

Please Note
As a reference towards the progress of Miami Air complying with FAR 117
I would like to include the following:

Beginning in January of 2012 under the new unenforceable regulation FAR 117, I have now completed 12 FDPâ€™s (Flighty Duty Periods) as a pilot in flight.

Of the 12 FDPâ€™s thus far 6 of them have exceeded limitations as established in FAR 117.

The following cases as acclimated and unaugmented:

(01JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 12+20, Report 0645L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 12+50
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 12+00

(03JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 13+45, Report 0130L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 14+05

(23JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 12+20, Report 1200L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 11+30
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 10+00

TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 10+00


(27 and 28FEB12) FDP Scheduled total 19+55, Report 1720L, 2 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 25+40
Reserve availability and FDP combined
Violation of FAR117.21(c) (1), (2), (3) and FAR 117.25(e)

&quot;To Whom it may concern,
Yesterday, September 19, 2012 I walkied into the In-Flight Department I guess moments after an oxygen canister had been brought up from the hangar.
It had been requested by the department for use in training.  They had just discovered that it was not empty and a phone call was made to advise this and inquire waht to do next about the oxygen canister.

Knowing we have had a serious and expensive episode in the past involving the mishandling of oxygen canisters I found this to be a bit unnerving.  I do not have any details and do not know what was said to lead up to what I saw but thought someone should know in order to ask those questions if deemed necessary.  Thank you&quot;"></attribute>

Subject: Hanger Entry

Hi Luigi,
 
   As I was entering the hanger thru the main entry door my foot slipped into a hole by the drainage grate, this was probably due to someone exiting the same time as I was entering and I had to stay to the right.  I was not injured but the posibility is there for someone to hurt themselves when entering, especially if it is bright outside and going into a darker area.  While our customers generally do not enter thru this door, on occasion, some have and if hurt, it could turn out very expensive for MAI.
 
     I have attached a picture of what I am refering to.  If the plate could be moved to the right or another plate added next to this one, it might improve the situation.
 
 
Thank You,
 
Bill

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="ATC cleared us to descend from FL340 to FL260 direct &quot;Norku&quot; on the arrival into AMS.  Before reaching &quot;Norku&quot; and prior to leveling at FL260, control assigned us a heading and a series of descents to lower altitudes, the last of which was FL100.  On one of the aforementioned descents the TCAS showed a target that was below us at approximately 5 nm at our one o'clock position, climbing from left to right.  The TCAS called out &quot;traffic&quot; for a brief moment (maybe 3 to 5 seconds).   In the correct manner, the TCAS showed the target go from white to amber as we came within approximately 5 nm and approximately 300ft climbing.  ATC had assigned us 250 KIAS on the descent and in &quot;Level Change&quot; mode this was yielding a rate of descent of approximately 1,500 fpm.  In response to the &quot;T/A&quot; advisory we decreased our rate of descent to less than 1,000fpm by commanding the &quot;Vertical Speed&quot; mode.
We continued to AMS with no further incident.

Neither of them were wearing any type of proper identification, so I challenged them.  One woman identified herself as an employee of J &amp; L Welding and she stated that she had left her id on her desk.  She claimed she was escorting her guest to the restroom.  I told her she had to wear proper identification to walk through the hangar and to obtain a leasehold badge or a J &amp; L Welding company id for her guest before proceeding through the hangar as failure to have proper identification is a violation of TSA regulations and Miami Air company policy."></attribute>

After take-off we realized the cabin was not pressurizing prpoerly. Followed Miami Air Cabin Alt. Warning checklist. AC packs were on. Door illumination Panel was not illuminated. We were then advised that the L1 door was not sealed properly. We landed and entered the item in the log book. Maintenance was preformed. The item was signed off. We were then cleared to proceed to Vancouver with no farther incident."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="The event occurred because either the sensor does not work properly or the door needs a secondary sensor to detect that the door is sealed correctly. Perhaps a primary latch and a secondary latch to seal the door ... ie two seperate fuctions to seal it."></attribute>

During the climb approx. 10 miles south of TUS @ approx 9000 ft., purser called cockpit advising of a loud noise (very loud rushing wind sound) coming from the L1 door.  Aircraft was leveled off, Flt. Mech. checked the door and found the door handle in the locked position (cockpit door light extinguished) but the door wasn't  seated properly in the frame preventing the door from being completely sealed.  TUS departure was advised and the aircraft was returned to TUS.  On the ground, the Flt. Mech. inspected the door and found everything satisfactory, closed the door properly, and the aircraft departed with no further problems."></attribute>

On 17MAR12 at around 0838L (1238z) Miami Air Scheduling Dept. notified me that I would be placed on short-call reserve at 2000L/17MAR12 // (0000z)/18MAR12. Reserve availability period to end 0729L (1129z) 18MAR12 a total of 11+29 hrs.

On 17MAR12 at around 0838L (1238z) Miami Air Scheduling Dept. also notified me that I had a trip assignment in addition to short-call reserve immediately following the reserve availability period.

Scheduled on duty Report time was 0730L (1130z)


Scheduled Trip 18MAR12
MIA to FLL (Limousine crew) 1200z to 1300z 
FLL to BMI (BSK626) 1500z to 1800z 
BMI to SAT (BSK521) 1900z to 2130z

Scheduled Off Duty Release time 2200z (18MAR12)

Total Scheduled FDP (Flight duty period) 10+00
Total Scheduled work hours on company time (On Duty to Scheduled Release) 10+30


Actual Trip Block times 18MAR12
Actual on duty Report time was 0730L (1130z)

MIA to FLL (Limousine crew) 1205z to 1227z 
FLL to BMI (BSK626) 1530z to 1825z 
BMI to SAT (BSK521) 1935z to 2200z

Actual Off Duty Release time 2230z / 1730L (18MAR12)
Actual Hotel Check-in time 2315z / 1815L (18MAR12)

Actual Total completed work hours (On Duty to Actual Release) 11+00
Actual Total completed work hours on company time (On Duty to Hotel check-in) 11+45

Actual FDP 10+30 (Ending at Aircraft Block-in Time)

During Flight Segment 3 (BMI to SAT) I believe I may have become fatigued due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.

FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on 18MAR12.

FAR 117.21 Reserve status.
Section (c) For short call reserve,
(2) For a flight crew member who has completed a reserve availability period, no certificate holder may schedule and no flight crew member may accept an assignment of a reserve availability period unless the flight crew member receives the required rest in Â§ 117.25(e).

[Â§ 117.25(e) affords the flight crew member a rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours immediately before beginning the reserve or flight duty period. As such the company stood in violation of section (c) (2) at report time of 0730L / 1130z (18MAR12) for not providing a 10 hour consecutive rest period.]

(3) For an unaugmented operation, the total number of hours a flight crew member may spend in a flight duty period and a reserve availability period may not exceed the lesser of the maximum applicable flight duty period in Table B of this part plus 4 hours, or 16 hours, as measured from the beginning of the reserve availability period.





Table B
Scheduled Time of Start (0730L)
Number of Flight Segments (2)

MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 14+00

[The total number of hours I spent in this flight duty period and in the reserve availability period totaled 20+00 hours. &lt;End of FDP time 1700L / 2200z (18MAR12) minus start of reserve availability period 2000L / (17MAR12) // 0000z (18MAR12)&gt; The company violated section (c) (3) limitation of 14 plus 4 = 18 hours or 16 hours as the lesser maximum.]


FAR 117.25 Rest period.
(e) No certificate holder may schedule and no flight crew member may accept an assignment for any reserve or flight duty period unless the flight crew member is given a rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours immediately before beginning the reserve or flight duty period measured from the time the flight crew member is released from duty. The 10 hour rest period must provide the flight crew member with a minimum of 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep opportunity.

Violation of 117.25 section (e) occurred at report time of 0730L / 1130z (18MAR12) for not providing a 10 hour consecutive rest period immediately before beginning the flight duty period.

Please Note
As a reference towards the progress of Miami Air complying with FAR 117
I would like to include the following:

Beginning in January of 2012 under the new unenforceable regulation FAR 117, I have now completed 14 FDPâ€™s (Flighty Duty Periods) as a pilot in flight.

Of the 14 FDPâ€™s thus far 7 of them have exceeded limitations as established in FAR 117.

The following cases as acclimated and unaugmented:

(01JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 12+20, Report 0645L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 12+50
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 12+00

(03JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 13+45, Report 0130L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 14+05

(23JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 12+20, Report 1200L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 11+30
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 10+00

(23FEB12) FDP Scheduled total 13+35, Report 0400L, 4 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 12+27
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 10+00


(27 thru 28FEB12) FDP Scheduled total 19+55, Report 1720L, 2 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 25+40
Reserve availability and FDP combined
Violation of FAR117.21(c) (1), (2), (3) and FAR 117.25(e)
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 16+00

(01MAR12) FDP Scheduled total 11+25, Report 0430L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 11+15
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 10+00
FLIGHT TIME Scheduled total 8+25, Actual FLIGHT TIME total 8+35
TABLE A MAX FLIGHT TIME 8+00

(18MAR12) FDP Scheduled total 21+30, Report 0730L, 2 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 22+00
Reserve availability and FDP combined
Violation of FAR117.21(c) (2), (3) and FAR 117.25(e)
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 16+00

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="The following narrative has been transcribed word for word from an email sent by Cpt. Steve Russo to Chief Pilot John Passwater the morning after the incident:

&quot;This letter is an incident report that occurred on 26 march 2014 at ASIG North ramp.  BSK 550 departed YQG Windsor, ONT. to DTW Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.  Weather was VFR upon arrival at 2050Z, 1650 lcl time.  We landed on 21L and exited to the right to taxi north on whiskey, cross 9L, left on Papa I made the comment to FO Nicolaas Kuyper that taxiway was in need of repair.  Upon arrival at ASIG North ground personal where marshaling us onto their ramp nose to the west.  I again made a comment to FO Kuyper that North ramp was in very bad shape.  I have enclosed pictures of ramp condition and a video of poor repair patch.

We cleared customs and where re-positioning under power to ASIG South.  Because we were empty with a light fuel load, I elected to start number 2 and perform a single engine taxi.  While applying thrust to taxi straight ahead then a left turn, I noticed that marshaler made a surprised facial expression however he continued to marshal us from the ramp.  I told FO Kuyper that marshaler made a surprised expression that I did not understand.  I did not use excessive thrust to taxi from ramp.  We made a left onto Papa and I looked back to ASIG North ramp and could see that ground personnel were looking at damage on the ramp.

Re-position to ASIG South was uneventful.  After shnutting down I asked FO Kuyper to accompany me on a post flight inspection because I wanted two sets of eyes to check for FOD damage to the engine.  NUmber 2 engine did not sustain any damage however the aircraft right horizontal stabilizer leading edge had received puncture damage.

Bill Hardin, General Manager ASIG was on scene right away and provided us with assets to inspect aircraft more closely.  He expressed to me that he has spoken with airport authority about condition of North ramp and that surface was not stable.  I also spoke to driver that took us back to North ramp for pictures and he said large aircraft did not park on North ramp only small business jets parked there.&quot;

On 07JUL12 at around 0939L (1339z) Miami Air Scheduling Dept. notified me that I would be placed on short-call reserve at 2000L/07JUL12 // (0000z)/08JUL12. Reserve availability period to end 1959L (2359z) 08JUL12 a total of 23+59 hrs.

On 07JUL12 at around 0939L (1339z) Miami Air Scheduling Dept. also notified me that I had a trip assignment after completion of the short-call reserve for 08JUL12 following such reserve availability period.

During Flight Segment 3 (MCO to MIA) I believe I may have become fatigued due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.

FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on (08 thru 09JUL12)

FAR 117.21 Reserve status.
Section (c) For short call reserve,

(1) The reserve availability period may not exceed 14 hours.

(2) For a flight crew member who has completed a reserve availability period, no certificate holder may schedule and no flight crew member may accept an assignment of a reserve availability period unless the flight crew member receives the required rest in Â§ 117.25(e).

[Â§ 117.25(e) affords the flight crew member a rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours immediately before beginning the reserve or flight duty period. As such the company stood in violation of section (c) (2) at report time of 0325L / 0725z (09JUL12) for not providing a 10 hour consecutive rest period.]


FAR 117.25 Rest period.
(e) No certificate holder may schedule and no flight crew member may accept an assignment for any reserve or flight duty period unless the flight crew member is given a rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours immediately before beginning the reserve or flight duty period measured from the time the flight crew member is released from duty. The 10 hour rest period must provide the flight crew member with a minimum of 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep opportunity.

Violation of 117.25 section (e) occurred at report time of 0325L / 0725z (09JUL12) for not providing a 10 hour consecutive rest period immediately before beginning the flight duty period.

FAR 117.11 Flight Time Limitation.
Table A
Scheduled Time of Start (0325L)
MAX FLIGHT TIME LIMIT = 8+00

8+25 scheduled FLIGHT TIME exceeded this limitation; 8+20 Actual FLIGHT TIME exceeded this limitation

During Flight Segment 3 (DSM to EIL) I believe I may have become fatigued due to the long duty day and due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.

Fatigue set in also in part due to the Miami Air APC delegated seats do not satisfy the requirements of a Class 3 rest facility and are less than adequate.


FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on 01JUN12.

Miami Air B737â€™s pilots rest facility does not qualify as a Class Three Rest Facility

For Reference: Class 3 rest facility means a seat in an aircraft cabin or flight deck that
reclines at least 40 degrees and provides leg and foot support.

Please Note

In the USA volume 1, I found that out of 17 revisions 7 of them were not signed off. Also the &quot;Q&quot; book contained all 8 &quot;Q&quot; updates when it should have contained only 2.(The other six were out of date and should have been discarded).
I have since then replaced the volume 1 on this aircraft with new contents from Jeppesen. I have also corrected the contents in the &quot;Q&quot; volume."></attribute>

The first instance occured on LL640 (17DEC09) with Captain Ross Fischer.

The second occured on LL644 (19DEC09) with FO Jan Slingenberg.

"></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="Two primary reasons and company SOP's were violated.

1.  The pushback crew had no headsets to effectively communicate with the cockpit.

2.  Lack of ability to maintain conversational english on the part of the tug driver."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="once_the_event_was_identified" value="When it was apparent that the tug was pushing against the aircraft, with the parking brake set, we opened the window and yelled, in english to STOP, since they had no headset.  Either they did not understand the english or the outside noise level was too high for us to be heard.  

With regard to LL644 on 19DEC09, I asked Dispatcher Slettmo to contact the Ground Handling company and get the name of a shift supervisor.  The person who answered the telephone refused to provide this information to the Dispatcher."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="avoiding_recurrence_of_this_event" value="Company SOP's regarding the use of headsets during pushback operations should be strictly observed, when possible.  If no headset is available, then prior communication between the tug driver and the pilots is essential to make certain that all parties involved have a clear understanding as to how to safely push back and tow the aircraft.

crew room for a trip. 
The trip was a ferry flight to PGD then a turn. PGD to IAG followed by a van ride back to MIA arriving 
4:30am local time the next day.
After reviewing the trip, I notified crew scheduling I would not be safe. And that I have already been on 
airport standby ( short call ) for 20hrs.
It is my opinion that the leg from IAG to PGD leaving at 11:00 pm arriving PGD at 01:30 am local would 
be too much. 
I woke this morning at 5 am and I would not have a chance to get any rest for over 24 hrs. I would have 
been on duty for over 33 hrs straight, operating the entire time during the window of circadian low.
I promptly received a call form my chief pilot requesting an explanation of, whether I was sick or fatigued. 
After clarifying I felt the assignment would be unsafe I was told to file a fatigue report ASAP.
At no time was a hotel or schedule change offered.

                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="Airport standby (&quot;short call&quot;) should reflect the new CFR's as a proven science we need now. 
Not in two years. 
It is unreasonable to expect someone to be ready to fly all night, then expect them to be fit for duty 20hs 
later.
If the company wants that amount of flexibility, they should loosen the purse strings and staff realistically.  "></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="After pushback from stand 10A, ground crew was told to disconnect towbar and show us the bypass pin.  Tug and towbar were clear of the aircraft and ramp worker on aircraft left was holding a pin in his hand, showing the crew.  After accomplishing the BEFORE TAXI CHECKLIST and receiving clearance to taxi, we realized that we had no control of our nose steering.  The aircraft was stopped, ground crew notified and the bypass pin was removed.  Apparently, the ramp worker was not experienced with our aircraft and was showing us the tow bar pin."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="Several factors contributed.  All week long at this same station the ground crew was using a bypass pin without a REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT streamer.  It was always included in our briefing between the pilots and the flight mechanic, as well as the pushback crew.  However, somehow this time something was missed.  I had not noticed this individual working our aircraft in previous stops at this station.

Language barrier was also a factor.  Limited ability on our part to speak French and on the part of the ramp workers to speak English.

Finally, crew fatigue.  Our crew had a very long day, the day before.  With only 8 hours in the hotel and upon checking in for our scheduled one leg day, a 20 minute flight, we were informed that we now had to work 6 legs and have another long duty day because another crew was not legal.  By the end of this second, unplanned, long day, we were noticibly fatigued, including this fact in every briefing but still simple errors were starting to creep in by the end of the day."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="once_the_event_was_identified" value="Ground crew was notified to come back to the aircraft and remove the bypass pin.  They were also seen &quot;harrassing&quot; the &quot;new guy&quot; for his error."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="avoiding_recurrence_of_this_event" value="First and foremost, PTP ground operations needs to have a REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT streamer on the bypass pin.  Any color will do but something that will help the flight crew visually determine that they are being shown the correct pin after pushback.

If communication verbally is not possible, an additional ground person should be available to utilize universal hand signals, rather than the limited verbal communication abilities between the flight crew and the tug driver."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="The following narrative involves an incident on N742MA - Captain R. Clager / First Officer R. Garcia on 3 Jan 2010.

At approximately 4 pm on Sunday, January 03, 2010, N742MA landed on Rwy 24R at CYUL.  The aircraft taxied to the Starlink FBO ramp 
adjacent to the departure end of Rwy 24L and blocked in at 4:15 pm.  While on the Starlink FBO Ramp, the aircraft was catered for the Buffalo 
Sabres Hockey team for the flight from CYUL to KBUF scheduled for a 7pm departure.

At approximately 6pm, N742MA started engines to reposition from Starlink FBO ramp to gate 72 at CYUL.  N742MA exited the Starlink ramp at 
the same point of entry earlier, between previously plowed snowbanks adjacent to taxiway R.  The aircraft taxied onto Twy R and turned right 
towards the Hold Short position for Rwy 24L as instructed by ATC.  Prior to reaching the Hold Short Point, the aircraft felt as though the nose 
wheel had turned sideways on the hard packed snow on Twy R and power was added to assist the turn.  The aircraft did not continue to move 
forward or turn and it was determined that the right main wheel assembly had either become stuck in a small snowbank, had displaced a grate 
on the tarmac under the snow, or had left the paved surface under the snow, contrary to what is depicted on the Jeppesen Airfield diagram as 
a fully paved area.  The engines were immediately secured (the APU was still online and providing electrical power and air conditioning for the 
repositioning of the aircraft).

Starlink FBO personnel brought out stairs and the right main assembly was inspected by the flight crew and flight mechanic.  The flight 
mechanic decided that there was no damage to the right main wheel assembly or tires and suggested the aircraft be towed forward by a tug.  
Multiple attempts to free the aircraft by tug were unsuccessful and maintenance control directed that no further attempts would be made. 
"></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="The event occurred because the ramp &amp; taxiway (Taxiway R) adjacent to the Starlink FBO were covered/obscured by snow and the Jeppeson 
Airfield diagram for CYUL (Chart 10-9) did not accurately depict the unpaved areas which existed between the ramp and Taxiway R and unpaved 
area NE of the Starlink FBO ramp and the Hold Short area for Runway 24 L."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="avoiding_recurrence_of_this_event" value="Aircrew should realize that, despite their best efforts to safely taxi aircraft in snow covered or otherwise adverse conditions, that errors in 
publications upon which all pilots rely may, in fact, contain errors which may lead to incidents such as this one.  These errors must be brought to 
the attention of those responsible for the publication of such information to ensure as much accuracy as possible, and aircrew must be aware that 
these errors can and do exist in the publications we are to utilize and to exercise extreme caution when adverse weather conditions exist which 
increase aircrew reliance on these publications."></attribute>

RWY 09 at KCID is scheduled for resurfacing due to its condition.  It is possible that the area on that 
runway at which rotation took place was at the intersection of the crossing runway which is listed as being 
in good condition.  Reduced tailskid clearance due to the poor condition of the active runway and the 
crown of the crossing runway may have been a causal factor."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="On February 18th, 2012 we had a 02:15 am local report time. The trip sequence started the day prior 
with a 04:45 am report, which I was notified on the 16th of the trip. I normally try to adjust my sleeping 
pattern if I am given adequate notice to do so, however I didnâ€™t know about the trip early enough on the 
16th to make any adjustments. I adjusted the sleeping pattern on the 17th. The 18th consisted of a four 
leg day flying out of a maintenance base with several deferred items, including an inoperative APU. Our 
day  was scheduled to fly into the Caribbean airports (PUJ, AUA &amp; MBJ). The fact that the APU was inop 
and getting the satisfactory ground equipment made for a challenging day alone not to mention we 
started at 2:15 am. Experiencing an inoperative APU caused extra delays on the tarmac and required 
extra communication with the ground handlers who in many cases did not answer their radios or said 
they were on their way when it took them a long time to arrive with the proper equipment. Itâ€™s hard to put 
into words or to quantify the degree of fatigue this trip caused, but the captain and I both agree that it 
was a fatiguing day and I therefore felt it required a fatigue report. 
 Scheduled for 9:25 hours of flying with a duty day of 14:55. We ended up flying 10:35 minutes and 
having 15:40 minutes of duty time.

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="About thru the flight from TLH to MIA I heard over the service intercom that FA Christine Proskie wasn't feeling well.  At around 500 feet AGL landing in MIA Purser Brulz called me and said that FA Proskie was passed out and needed the paramedics.  I called the tower immediately and asked for the paramedics to meet us at the gate.  We pulled up to the gate and the paramedics were there within 2 minutes.  FA Proskiewas taken outside into the terminal.  After the passsengers were deplaned, I went into the terminal to see the condition of FA Proskie.  The paramedics released her but one of the paramedics pulled me to the side and told me that she was seeing evil spirits and was trying to cast them out.  FA Proskie got back on the airplane and we taxied back to Miami Air's hangar.  After we parked, Purser Anita Brulz came to me and said that FA Proskie was sick again and was laying down on teh seats.  I went to see heer and saw that she had a plastic bag over her mouth likme she was getting ready to vomit.  I told her that she could stay in the airplane until she felt better.  I didn't want her to come down the stairs if she was feeling dizzy.  However, she said she was fine and proceeded to get off the airplane and sat down on a chair.  I left the hangar but had to return to retrieve the Trip Envelope.  FA Proskie was now sitting in the breakroom.  Mr. Rafael de la Paz told me that FA Proskie wanted me to leave the hangar and that she was &quot; walking around like a zombie&quot; and makeing the cross sign with her hands.  I called Ms. Billie De Palma a second tine and told her that FA Proskie was still in teh hangar.  Ms. DePalma recommended that I call the paramedics one more time.  I called MIA ground control and asked for the paramedics a second time.  Again they arrive a few minutes later.  
P.S. attached is the name of the paramedic that assisted FA Proskie - Lt. Keith Seafield, Rescue 12 (MIA) Website (Divine Trinity)"></attribute>

During Flight Segment 4 (PUJ to MIA) I believe I may have become fatigued due to the long duty day and due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.

FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on 23FEB12.

FAR 117.13 Flight Duty Period: Unaugmented operations
Table B
Scheduled Time of Start (0400L)
Number of Flight Segments (4)

MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 10+00
13+35 scheduled FDP exceeded this limitation; 12+27 Actual FDP exceeded this limitation

Please Note
As a reference towards the progress of Miami Air complying with FAR 117
I would like to include the following:

Beginning in January of 2012 under the new unenforceable regulation FAR 117, I have now completed 10  FDPâ€™s (Flighty Duty Periods) as a pilot in flight.

Of the 10 FDPâ€™s thus far 4 of them have exceeded limitations as established in FAR 117.

All cases as acclimated and unaugmented

(01JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 12+20, Report 0645L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 12+50
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 12+00

(03JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 13+45, Report 0130L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 14+05
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 9+00

(23JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 12+20, Report 1200L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 11+30
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 10+00

(23FEB12) FDP Scheduled total 13+35, Report 0400L, 4 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 12+27
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 10+00

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Our crew of 6 checked in at 9:00am local for a flight to SKB then to SFB where we were scheduled to be picked up by the Miami Air crew van and driven back to Miami, a 4 to 4.5 hour drive beginning at 7:45pm.  The driver was there on time and we began our drive to Miami.  I questioned the driver as to what he had done prior to picking us up.  He stated that he had driven another crew to SFB in the morning and had just been &quot;hanging out&quot; until we arrived.  After dropping off the other crew, he had about 7 hours in between drives that he could have been resting in a hotel room, but Miami Air management didn't provide him with that option.  My casual observation of the driver indicated that he was fatigued.

About 1.5 hours into the drive, I noticed that the driver was starting to have trouble staying in one lane, periodically drifting from the left lane to the center and back again.  About 2.5 hours into the drive, the driver drifted off the roadway and onto the shoulder of the road.  Several of the other crew members including my self, yelled at the driver who was startled and drove back onto the road.  We stopped in Ft. Pierce for about 15 minutes to stretch and &quot;wake-up&quot;.  The driver was asked repeatedly if he was OK to continue driving and he replyed that he was.  We arrived in Miami a little after midnight without further incident."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="This event occurred because the driver was fatigued from not being afforded adequate facilities in which to rest.  We were just split seconds away from a real disaster.  If the van would have continued to drive off the paved shoulder catching the soft dirt, this would have been a real disaster at the speed were were traveling, we would have made the headlines and people probably would have lost their lives..  Also, on the other side, if another car or truck had been next to us on the right side when the driver drifted into the center lane, another impending disaster."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="that_an_event_had_occurred" value="Driver was drifting from lane to lane, then off the road"></attribute>
                    <attribute name="once_the_event_was_identified" value="Stopped the van in order to wake up the driver"></attribute>
                    <attribute name="avoiding_recurrence_of_this_event" value="I'm told that our agreement with Luigi is that  a van trip over 3.5 hours requires a day room for the driver prior to the beginning of a trip.  Luigi is under the mistaken impression that a drive from Sanford, or even Orlando (which is a little closer)  takes 3.5 hours or less.  That's possible if you drive at 90 and don't hit any traffic.  Once again, someone is &quot;pinching the buck&quot; and putting our crews at risk.  Also, the driver had already driven a trip beginning in the early morning hours to SFB and then had to wait all day before picking us up.  Whoever scheduled this used very poor judgement.  Either require the driver to rest in a day room, or hire a professional company to do the driving."></attribute>

Actual FDP 13+45 (Ending at Aircraft Block-in Time)

During Flight Segment 4 (LEX to MSY) I believe I may have become fatigued due to the long duty day and due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.

Fatigue set in also due to fellow co-workers not following established procedures to enhance pilot rest in a designated Miami Air cabin (passenger) seat. The Normal seats reserved for APC duties were not blocked out by the flight crew and regular customers were permitted to use them.  In addition Miami Air APC delegated seats do not satisfy the requirements of a Class 3 rest facility and are less than adequate.

Furthermore I would like to report that on flight segment 4 the other FO did not have to sit in an aisle seat as I had during my delegated rest on flight segment 2. In the aisle seat and with 2 other revenue customers sitting immediately next to me the rest facility provided to me was quite unfair. There were many times that I was bumped by traffic in the aisle while trying to rest.

Also I have filed legitimate grievances concerning the same issue in the past and have suffered retribution by the company for doing so. Therefore I did not make any confrontation with the flight crew because in essence I learned my lesson the last time. The company has created and continues to endorse a climate of intimidation for people like me that have tried to do the right thing and educate fellow crew members of FAA approved pilot crew rest procedures in the past only to be subject to negative consequences and continued harassment and abuse as one of the companies â€œwhipping boysâ€. In essence, company management supports favorites when it comes to following the FAA approved procedures and does not support their own written procedures concerning individual employees that it does not consider in good favor.

I am certain that the company culture as indicated also contributed to my fatigue and an inability to achieve good rest while not standing duty in flight as a pilot behind one of the two controls either acting as PM or PF

FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on 30MAR12.

FAR 117.17 Flight Duty Period: Augmented flight crew
Table C
Scheduled Time of Start (0135L)
Number of Flight Segments (4)
Number of Pilots (3)
Less than Class Three Rest Facility

MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD (For Class Three Rest Facility) = 13+00
MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD Table B (due to Lack of Class Three Rest Facility) = 9+00
13+30 scheduled FDP exceeded this limitation; 13+45 Actual FDP exceeded this limitation

Miami Air B737â€™s pilots rest facility does not qualify as a Class Three Rest Facility

For Reference: Class 3 rest facility means a seat in an aircraft cabin or flight deck that
reclines at least 40 degrees and provides leg and foot support.

Please Note
As a reference towards the progress of Miami Air complying with FAR 117
I would like to include the following:

Beginning in January of 2012 under the new unenforceable regulation FAR 117, I have now completed 19 FDPâ€™s (Flighty Duty Periods) as a pilot in flight.

Of the 19 FDPâ€™s thus far 10 of them have exceeded limitations as established in FAR 117.

The following cases as acclimated and augmented:


(25 thru 26MAR12) FDP Scheduled total 13+20, Report 1200L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 13+50
Due to Lack of a Class 3 Rest Facility
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 13+00

(30MAR12) FDP Scheduled total 13+30, Report 0130L, 4 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 13+45
Due to Lack of a Class 3 Rest Facility
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 9+00

My car was the last executive car parked in the lot.  MG Bus had a large bus parked diagonally with the rear of the bus adjacent to the hose nozzle on the outside of the pan am building.  There was a panel open on the rear of the bus and fluid was being drained  from the bus and was puddling around the area enough that the fluid was underneath my car and had to be stepped in for me to enter my car.  I asked the personnel at the MG bus what the fluid was as the odor from the fluid had a sewage smell.  The person told me the sink on the bus was leaking.  I challenged him and asked if it was sewage from a bathroom on the bus.  He hesitated to answer then said no.  He immediately grabbed the hose and began spraying hose water on the parking lot.  I got in my car, drove a few feet away and watched them bring another large bus to the MAI executive parking area and maintenance on that bus second bus commenced."></attribute>

just after New Years eve celebrations.

PGD to ORH (BSK5802) 1200z to 1458z
ORH to SFB (BSK5805) 1610z to 1905z

Off Duty 1935z
Hotel Check-in 2005z

I was notified of the scheduled one day trip at around 0900L (1400z) 31DEC2011
after going to sleep at my normal circadium rythm friday night 30DEC2011 after getting an 11 hour notice the prior evening at 1901L (0001z 31DEC) of my placement to short-call (reserve) that began at 0600L (1100z) 31DEC2011. My wife began to enquire about getting some rest and going back to bed soon at around 1030L (1530z) 31DEC2011 because of the early report time of 0145L (0645z) 01JAN2012. I explained to her that even if I went to bed that I would not go to sleep because I had gone to bed friday night to be sure I was rested in case I was called out from short-call (reserve) during that particular day 31DEC2011. Therefore there is no way I could appropriate rest for both requirements.

I completed 13 hours of short-call standby (reserve) from home on 31 DEC 2011.
From 0600L (1100z) to 1900L (2400z)

Following this I received 6:45 hours rest prior to report time (0645z 01JAN2012)
Of the 6:45 rest approximately, 2-2.5 hours of time spent in preparation to arrive at report time from home.

Despite efforts by the entire crew to rest the day and night of 31DEC2011 prior to Miami Air scheduled report time all crew members discussed difficulties in getting adequate rest due to Fireworks nearby everyones' homes that evening.

Due to a long scheduled crew van ride from Miami Airport (Miami Air Office Headquarters) to PGD airport of 3 hours and appropriate new years's events the company should have realized the gravity of such a situation.

Next year it would be strongly prudent to short call the crew to report on 31DEC in the morning to give them a cew van ride to a hotel near PGD airport because of the New Years expected fireworks and events. This would at the very least avoid the long van ride with tired bodies before setting out on the completion of a scheduled 12:20 duty day. This would cut off a good 3 hours from such a long duty day after fighting to sleep during fireworks that begins after sundown.

Despite strong efforts by all crewmembers to take deep breaths, be team players, and try to complete our duty assignment, I and other crewmembers became fatigued during the last flight segment ORH to SFB.

Lastly, as a point of fact, the 12:20 scheduled duty day with a report time of 0145 local time, New Years night or not, does not comply with the new unenforceable FAA duty fight duty period restrictions. Also, the 6:45 rest after short-call (reserve) assignment does not comply with the new unenforceable FAA duty regulations."></attribute>

approach course of 345 degrees) Boston Approach advises that a helicopter is in the vicinity, between my 
aircraft and the intended point of landing, and has my aircraft in sight and that the helicopter will maintain 
visual separation as I am cleared to intercept localizer Rwy 34 at 2000' for landing Rwy 34 at PSM.  At 1/2 
mile left of localizer, aircraft captures localizer and turns left to intercept inbound course (345 degrees).  
Established on localizer and slightly high, aircraft maneuvered to intercept glideslope at YOKNZ at 1700', 
but 
upon completion (rollout) of turn onto final approach course, TCAS warning initiates with &quot;Traffic&quot;, 
immediately followed by Resolution Advisory (RA) warning to &quot;Climb&quot;.  I estimate that at the initiation of the 
RA, the helicopter was less than 1/2 mile from YOKNZ at 1500' (YOKNZ fix is the Final Approach Fix for ILS 
Rwy 34 and is &quot;on glideslope&quot; at 1700').  The autopilot was disengaged and the aircraft was maneuvered in 
compliance with the RA.  Once clear of conflict, the aircraft continued on visual approach and was manually 
flown to uneventful landing on Rwy 34 at PSM.  I contacted the controller after the flight and she apologized 
for the incident as she did not realize that her maneuvering instructions would initiate a TCAS event."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="I was on a 24 hour brake begining on Dec. 31, 2011, begining at 1901 local to January 1, 2012 1900 local.  On January 1, 2012 around 930 am I received an e mail notifying me of a trip on January 3 with a report time at 250 am report time local. At the same time on January 1 I was notified of my short call reserve status begining january 1, 1900 local to january 2, 1900 local. With this information I decided to  re-arange my sleep schedule begining the night of January 1 to be able to sleep during the day on January 2, 2012. On the morning of january 2 around 930 am local I was contacted by scheduling department and confirmed for my trip leaving on the January 3 with a 250 am local time report with a 12 hour duty day, my short reserved call status remained in place until 1900 local on January 2, 2012. At around 1210 local on January 2 I was contacted by scheduling to report within 1 hour 30 minute for a 4 leg trip sequence and 12 hour 15 minute duty day, my intentions was to go to sleep early evening on january 2 in preperation for the trip leaving early on january 3 that I was already checked for by the scheduling department. Since I had reduce sleep from the previous day  the effects of fatiqued where not that apperant initially since it was in the middle of the day. The fatiqued begun to affect me as the evening of january 2 when on, the fatiqued became borderline exhaustion. If you have any further question please do not hesitate to contact me."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="The best way to eliminate this situation from happening again is.
1. Do not place a pilot on a short call status the previous day prior to a flying duty period begining between midnight and 5 am the following day. 
2. If a pilot is to be placed on short call status he should be relieved of the short call duty status when the pilot is checked formally by scheduling, for the trip that they are originally assigned that has report time of midnight and 5 am the following day. 

If you have any questions please contact me. "></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Aircraft N738MA was parked on the Atlantic Aviation ramp.  It had been brought in by a previous crew the day before. When we arrived at the aircraft, it was around 03:30 LT and it was still dark out on the ramp.  The ramp was congested with aircraft from two major conventions in town.

During taxi on the uncontrolled ramp, we only had two ground Marshalls taxing us.  The first Marshaller, with wands, was in front of our aircraft.  The second Marshaller, with no wands, was at a distance on our left side and under the vertical stabilizer of one of two B-737 parked next to each other.

We began our taxi and came close to hitting the stabilizer of the B-737 (that the second Marshaller was standing under) with our right winglet."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="After engine start and after the â€œbefore taxi checklistâ€ was completed, the Marshall in front of our aircraft directed us to taxi forward and make a hard left.  The ramp does not have any defined taxi lines or lines depicting its shape, nor does the Jeppesen diagram.

After making the left turn, the Marshaller in front of us was now out of sight and the second Marshaller (who had started on our left) had moved across my field vision and of out of my sight to the right of our aircraft.  The First Officer watched the second Marshaller on our right wingtip to see if we were clear to continue taxing North along the row of aircraft.  The First Officer, watching the second Marshaller, then said we were clear to continue.

Next, the First Officer saw the first Marshaller, the one with with wands, run about 100 yards from the back of the aircraft to the front right side, where the second Marshaller was standing.  The first Marshaller signaled us to stop the aircraft and shut down our engines.  I immediately stopped the aircraft and shut down the engines.

We inspected the wingtip to see if there was any damage.  There had been no contact with the other aircraft.  After talking to the ground personnel, we learned that the first Marshaller had wanted us to make a left, then a right, to go through a narrow opening between the two B-737 w/winglets.

My assessment of why this event occurred is that there was a miscommunication between the two ground Marshalls and with the fight deck.  The first Marshaller assumed we knew that he had intended for us to go through the narrow opening between the two B-737s and the second Marshaller did not give any signals to which way to go.  "></attribute>
                    <attribute name="that_an_event_had_occurred" value="Marshaller singled us to stop and shut down the aircraft."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="once_the_event_was_identified" value="We inspected the wingtip to see if there was any damage.  There had been no contact with the other aircraft.  

I elected to be towed out to the taxiway because I did not think that I could maneuver the airplane under power through the narrow opening to the taxiway.  They assured me that I could because the manger on duty had measured the distance between the two B737 and there was five feet of room to maneuver with.

Despite being given this advice, I still elected to be towed between the two B737s.  While being towed, the tug could not pull us straight through the opening.  They towed us close to one aircraft, at a 45 degree angle to clear the winglets and then put us at another 45 degree angle to clear the nose of the other aircraft.  I would guess about 2-3 feet clearance per side.
"></attribute>
                    <attribute name="avoiding_recurrence_of_this_event" value="Atlantic Aviation could use more ground personnel.

Marshallers should be communicating with the flight deck with signals at all times and should be standing in the appropriate place (under the wing tip of the aircraft they want us to taxi between and not under the vertical stabilizer).

One of the B737s should have been moved out of the way, making a clear path to the active taxiway.

Most importantly, improve communication between ground crew and flight deck regarding where they want the aircraft to taxi.  "></attribute>

Once in Miami it was 2 pm Sunday. Driving home was challenging. 
Before I stated this trip sequence, I asked scheduling for a room in LAX but they denied it saying that my 
day was perfectly legal. I did not check the extended duty day box on my bid sheet. I thought anything over 
16 need my permission. A hotel in MIA wasn't offered either and I had to drive home. The trip was a

During Flight Segment2 (DAB to CLT) I believe I may have become fatigued due to the long duty day and due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.




FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on 27FEB12 and 28FEB12

FAR 117.21 Reserve status.
Section (c) For short call reserve,
(1) The reserve availability period may not exceed 14 hours.

[I completed a reserve availability period on short-call reserve for a total of 14+20 hours at update #1 report time of 1720L / 2220z (27FEB12) in violation of section (c) (1).]


(2) For a flight crew member who has completed a reserve availability period, no certificate holder may schedule and no flight crew member may accept an assignment of a reserve availability period unless the flight crew member receives the required rest in Â§ 117.25(e).

[Â§ 117.25(e) affords the flight crew member a rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours immediately before beginning the reserve or flight duty period. As such the company stood in violation of section (c) (2) at update #1 report time of 1720L / 2220z (27FEB12) for not providing a 10 hour consecutive rest period.]


(3) For an unaugmented operation, the total number of hours a flight crew member may spend in a flight duty period and a reserve availability period may not exceed the lesser of the maximum applicable flight duty period in Table B of this part plus 4 hours, or 16 hours, as measured from the beginning of the reserve availability period.

Table B
{Update #1} New Scheduled Time of Start (1720L)
Number of Flight Segments (2)

MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 12+00

[The total number of hours I spent in this flight duty period and in the reserve availability period totaled 25+40 hours. &lt;End of FDP time 0450L / 0940z (28FEB12) minus start of reserve availability period 0300L / 0800z (27FEB12)&gt; The company violated section (c) (3) limitation of 12 plus 4 = 16 hours maximum.]


FAR 117.25 Rest period.
(e) No certificate holder may schedule and no flight crew member may accept an assignment for any reserve or flight duty period unless the flight crew member is given a rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours immediately before beginning the reserve or flight duty period measured from the time the flight crew member is released from duty. The 10 hour rest period must provide the flight crew member with a minimum of 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep opportunity.

Violation of 117.25 section (e) occurred at update #1 report time of 1720L / 2220z (27FEB12) for not providing a 10 hour consecutive rest period immediately before beginning the flight duty period.


Please Note
As a reference towards the progress of Miami Air complying with FAR 117
I would like to include the following:

Beginning in January of 2012 under the new unenforceable regulation FAR 117, I have now completed 11  FDPâ€™s (Flighty Duty Periods) as a pilot in flight.

Of the 11 FDPâ€™s thus far 5 of them have exceeded limitations as established in FAR 117.

All cases as acclimated and unaugmented

(01JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 12+20, Report 0645L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 12+50
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 12+00

The Purser notified me that there was a passenger walking around in the cabin, refusing instructions to be seated and to fasten his seat belt, telling the flight attendants to &quot;shut up.&quot;  In their opinion, he smelled of alcohol and his eyes were quite red.

We advised Ground Control and Operations that we needed to return to the stand, to advise security that we were removing a passenger from the aircraft.  We made a turn on the ramp and parked the airplane.  Secured the #1 engine to allow the door to open.  Security removed the passenger and his belongings.  We confirmed with the manifest that he had no checked baggage.

It had been brought to my attention that the vets would appreciate it if, the capital flag could be hung out the window upon our return to Ocala.
I thought it would be a nice gesture and discussed it with the crew, we came up with the plan to have the number one engine shut down after we passed under the fire hoses. And after it slowed below 20% N1 the mechanic would open the window and hold the flag out until we finished our parking check list, at the parking spot.
I did not take into consideration we would be making a right turn. Turning into an operating engine, fortunately we had the momentum to use minimum thrust on the number 2 engine. If we had not it would have required us to use a large amount of thrust much to close to people and vehicles. 
It worked out this time, but after reviewing the unsuccessful second attempt and thinking about our number 2 engine thrust requirement. I will not do it again.

Actual FDP 11+30

During Flight Segment 3 (PIE to MIA) I believe I may have become fatigued due to the long duty day and due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.

FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on 23JAN12.

(22JAN12) 0100z through (23JAN12) 1200z issued Long-call reserve status
(23JAN12) FDP total 11+30

Violation of 117.25 section (b) occurred at (23JAN12) report time with no 30 consecutive hrs rest in previous 7 days (168 hrs)

Please Note
As a reference towards the progress of Miami Air complying with FAR 117
I would like to include the following:

Beginning in January of 2012 under the new unenforceable regulation FAR 117, I have completed 5 FDPâ€™s (Flighty Duty Periods) as a pilot in flight.

Of the 5 FDPâ€™s thus far 3 of them have exceeded limitations as established in FAR 117.
Only 1 of the 5 was conducted as an Augmented operation and that FDP was originally scheduled to exceed the limitations as established by FAR 117, however due to aircraft maintenance problems and rescheduling the adjusted FDP became compliant with FAR 117 Table C.
Original augmented scheduled FDP 15+15, Report time 0530L, 3 flight segments.
Adjusted augmented schedule FDP 14+40, Report time 0530L, 3 flight segments, Actual FDP 14+08


All cases as acclimated an unaugmented

(01JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 12+20, Report 0645L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 12+50
TABLE B MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD = 12+00

(03JAN12) FDP Scheduled total 13+45, Report 0130L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 14+05

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="This portion of the trip occurred on day 4 of a 5 day sequence.  On the 28th zulu day, we also had a 24 hour break in PTK.  Preceeding the show, I slept until 0800 L.  I had every intention of sleeping later, but with all the noise in the hotel, it was not possible.  I did, however stay lounging in bed until around 11:30.  I know that even if I'm not sleeping, being sedentary actually helps me gain additional rest.

Due to the nature of the trip and the &quot;high profile&quot; of the client, the catering rep requested that the show time in PTK be increased to 3+0.  I immediately saw the problem with this.  The sequence was already built onto the backside of the clock and was scheduled at 9+45 hrs of flight with two pilots.  I felt that there was no justifiable reason for the pilots to be there so early and could exacerbate the potential for fatigue.  I alerted the Chief Pilot to this.  He agreed and the show time for the pilots was returned to the original 1+30.

The first leg from PTK to LAX was uneventful, save for departing PTK almost 1 hour late for passenger convenience.  The captain and I did, however, extensively brief the arrival and approach into LAX.  The aircraft we were flying had a DMI for an inoperative fuel guage.  This precluded us from using VNAV.  The arrivals into LAX often include many step downs and crossing restrictions.  Not having VNAV greatly increased our workload.

Due to the delay in the departure from PTK, the purser suggested that we could minimize the ground time in LAX by having the F/A's clean the aircraft.  The company disagreed and a light cleaning was performed at the FBO.  This added an additional 20 minutes to the ground time.

The departure from LAX was intially normal.  During the climb out, though, we were issued a clearance to fly direct to a fix that was not in the FMC.  I recalled that it was on the departure plate and the captain requested it.  At first I didn't know where it was, but then realized that during rotation and climb out, the plates and weather package had all slid off the center console and now lay on the floor.  The captain remarked that a sloppy cockpit was the first sign of fatigue.  Turned out he was right.  We proceeded as cleared.  The second noticeable event occurred just prior to level off at our final altitude.  As I slowed the rate of climb, I looked at the altimeter and realized that we had not set it to standard as we passed through FL 180.  Fortunately, this was caught prior to an altitude deviation.

As we continued on our route of flight, the cockpit was really quiet.  It's important because it was such a significant change from every leg prior on this rotation, including the inbound leg from PTK.  Each leg, we'd chatted nearly incessantly, mostly about work, but just all sorts of things, too.  I also noticed that I was starting to really feel tired.  I began yawning a lot and the captain asked if I was okay.  I replied that I was, but decided that I needed to do something to distract myself.  I decided to tidy up the cockpit.  I began by putting away the charts for LAX and ONT.  I reorganized the trip envelopes, ensured all the receipts were properly entered, and then got to work on my flight bag.  This is where things really went down hill.  Every time I went to get something from the bag, my hands became entangled in the spiral cords for the hand held mic or the removable map light.  It set me off in a way that hasn't happened in a long time.  It surprised me because it's not a normal reaction for me.  It reminded me of being a little kid and having things go wrong leading to nap time.  I knew it was from fatigue.  It was also during this time (about 0200 eastern) that I started really feeling wiped out, heavy eyelids, basically all the symptons of dozing off.  I decided that it was time for some coffee.  This helped some and coupled with a walk to the back of the aircraft, and constantly busying myself with any tasks that I could think of, slowly started to increase my level of alertness.  I did notice, though, that the captain seemed to be experienceing similar symptons, noticeably head drooping and a little yawning.  The big thing, though was the radios.  While I don't think we missed a significantly increased number of calls, we surely missed more than a few.  We never lost a frequency, but as it gets awfully quiet at that time of night, we often thought that we'd missed a hand-off and were now out of range.  Thankfully that was never the case, but we were second guessing ourselves more than usual.

Fortunately, due to the lack of traffic at that time of night, we were able to skip the arrival and request dircet routing with our own descent/speed profile.  Again due to a lack of the VNAV from the DMI, this was really important in reducing our workload.  The arrival into PIT was an ILS in visual conditions with a quartering tailwind to 32.  This was also uneventful, and we taxied to the ramp.  We were both pretty happy to be done.

We went to the hotel and I was in bed just before 0500L.  Unfortunately again due to hotel noise, I only got about 4 hours of sleep.  I am very glad that my duty assignment today only has me as a passenger.  I would not be safe to be part of a working crew tonight.

While I relaize that under the current FAR's that this sequence was legal, it was very challenging and definitely required the crew to be extra vigilant.  We were both fine going into LAX, and that was a good thing, as the lack of VNAV and deteriorating weather conditions really increased our workload.  We were lucky that the weather in PIT cooperated and gave us an easy approach.  Had we had similar conditions as in LAX, it would have made a challenging night that much more difficult and unsafe."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="As a company, we really need to evaluate and minimize backside of the clock repositioning flight..  The Chief Pilot moving our show back to  the standard 1+30 certainly helped, but in reality it didn't do a lot to help.  Short of shutting the sequence down upon arrival at LAX, the safest course of action would have been to have an APC as part of the crew.  Additionally, that APC could have been added in LAX.  this would have made him/her as fresh as possible.  The APC could have functioned as the flying pilot on the LAX-PIT leg, allowing the other tow crew members sufficient rest, significantly increasing the margin of safety and virtually eliminating the fatigue in this sequence."></attribute>

block flight time on 15 hous 30 minute duty day.  Only reason was able to fly last leg was because ferry flight, 1 hour 50 min.  This trip was 
designed to the maximum limit. Times were not due to any kind of weather delays. 

In addition to extreme duty and flight time during back side of clock flying, hotel location was across street from college football stadium during 
bowl game. Also US mens Rugby team at hotel which was booked full. Attempting Normal sleep during daytime hours in this type of situation 
is almost impossible.

Actual FDP 14+32 (Ending at Aircraft Block-in Time)

During Flight Segment 3 (NAS to JFK) I believe I may have become fatigued due to the long duty day and due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.

Fatigue set in also in part due to the Miami Air APC delegated seats do not satisfy the requirements of a Class 3 rest facility and are less than adequate.

Furthermore I would like to report that on flight segment 1 there were 170 pax of which 4 of them sat in row 30 (the same row as the Normally delegated APC seat). There were multiple disturbances while attempting rest during this flight segment to include babiesâ€™ cries, loud talking passengers, loud talking FAâ€™s and kicks of the feet from the passenger immediate in front at seat 29A.



FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on 15APR12.

FAR 117.17 Flight Duty Period: Augmented flight crew
Table C
Scheduled Time of Start (0515L)
Number of Flight Segments (3)
Number of Pilots (3)
Less than Class Three Rest Facility

MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD (For Class Three Rest Facility) = 13+00
MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD Table B (due to Lack of Class Three Rest Facility) = 12+00
13+40 scheduled FDP exceeded this limitation; 14+32 Actual FDP exceeded this limitation

Miami Air B737â€™s pilots rest facility does not qualify as a Class Three Rest Facility

For Reference: Class 3 rest facility means a seat in an aircraft cabin or flight deck that
reclines at least 40 degrees and provides leg and foot support.

Please Note
As a reference towards the progress of Miami Air complying with FAR 117
I would like to include the following:

Beginning in January of 2012 under the new unenforceable regulation FAR 117, I have now completed 24 FDPâ€™s (Flighty Duty Periods) as a pilot in flight.

Of the 24 FDPâ€™s thus far 11 of them have exceeded limitations as established in FAR 117.

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="I was called on reserve to report at 0415 L.  The call was at 10 or so local.  I was called again later in the day to advise that I was now an 
active crew member for all three legs instead of just the last.  In the late afternoon, I was again called to
Move the show to 0330.  I was in bed at 2000L, but was unable to fall asleep due to not prepping the night before.  I was very fatigued on the 
drive in.  The first leg to ADW, I was an ineffectual crew member.  The second leg, was not too bad, but still, I was not a great asset.  I was 
the flying pilot on the third leg and my energy levels were okay, but by not having sufficient notification to prepare for a 0415L show, that 
became a 0400L show, and then a 0330L show, for a 15 hour duty day into an environment where English was not the primary language 
created a very challenging, difficult and unsafe environment.  The worst part was being informed by the crew that this trip had been on their 
line for a significant time and was by no means a &quot;pop up&quot; trip.  Additionally, I should note that it turns out that I'm not doing well physically.  
The captain was so concerned about my excessive coughing and hoarse voice on the last leg that he urged me to call in sick for my SBY duty 
the next day.  I have done so.  It is my second sick call in 4 years, and it is obvious to me that my condition was exacerbated by a lack of 
sufficient rest from a poorly constructed trip sequence/notification process."></attribute>

As soon as the load cleared the van, the pallet tilted to the left and the two main wheels rolled against the company van that was parked in the parking lot in front of the hangar, causing some damage to the front fender of the van.  I immediately called the maintenance supervisor (luigi) so that he come inspect the damage.  After that, Douglas Koby and myself stood up the MWA.  At that moment, I inspected the tires for damage from the repair station as usual.  At that time, I strained the pinky finger on my right hand."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Trip began with a two leg commercial from Miami (MIA) to Knoxville (TYS).  Was scheduled for an 
approximate 37 hour layover in Knoxville, TN (TYS).  The company (Crew Scheduling) scheduled a 2:50 am 
Local report time after the layover to fly two live flights (TYS-CLE &amp; CLE-EWR) with a scheduled 8:10 am 
Local block in time into Newark, NJ (EWR).  The allowable FDP period was 9 hours.

Upon waking up the morning before the report time for the two live flights, crew scheduling had sent an 
updated schedule that included a commercial home after the two live flights.  The total duty period would be 
15:36.  Our report time would start at 2:50 am Local and end at 6:26 pm Local.
The new schedule had a commercial from Newark (EWR) to Detroit (DTW) followed by a commercial from 
Detroit (DTW) to Ft Lauderdale (FLL) followed by a LIMO to Miami (MIA).

Tue23Sep  Local times
LL674 TYS - CLE 0420 0545
LL674 CLE - EWR 0635 0810
DL3363 EWR - DTW 1100 1251
DL1704 DTW - FLL 1401 1656
LIMO674 FLL - MIA 1726 1826

The scheduled report time was 2:50 am Local at the aircraft.  That resulted in a taxi departure time from the 
hotel lobby of 2:30 am Local.  Which meant that I had a 1:30 am Local wake up time to get ready for the trip.  
I was only able to obtain about three (3) hours of sleep the night prior.  I was unable to plan for additional 
sleep as our schedule showed a release in Newark (EWR) originally.  Our updated schedule with the 
commercial home was not updated/received until the morning of our late night/early morning report time.

The company did not utilize any of the direct flights or &quot;more direct&quot; flights from EWR to FLL or MIA.  Instead, 
it utilized the cheapest option without any regard to sleep patterns, fatigue etc of the crews.  After the 
scheduled block into EWR, the company had scheduled a commercial home with three segments totaling 
over ten hours of travel time to get from EWR to MIA.  

The FAA, through FAR 117, recognizes that in the event of our report time, a duty period (FDP) of 9 hours is 
the maximum permitted before crew members are unsafe to operate an aircraft.  Miami Air has extended the 
duty period by almost seven (7) hours extra.  This will obviously result in fatigued crews.  Any person who 
observes the scheduled itinerary will know that this is a very fatiguing trip/day.

Route ID : TYS2/3"></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="If the company provides last minute schedule changes, it is impossible for the crew member to plan sleep 
accordingly.  I recommend that the company provide at least 48 hours notice to crew members so that the 
sleep period prior to the affected sleep period can be adjusted accordingly to minimize fatigue issues.  
Because travel is &quot;busy&quot;, does not excuse or resolve the issue that crews will become fatigued without 
proper notice of normal sleep interruptions in advance.  Without planning, sleep interruptions will result in 
fatigue.

Travel and Crew Scheduling should actually take into account the affects of schedules on fatigue.  It appears 
that cost of commercials and legality are the only two variables that are considered.  There is no 
consideration for crew schedules and fatigue effects.

Sun, 21 Aug 2011 20:23 Z
Prior to closing the door in BJV, PAX Ellen Hazelaar, said she did not feel well, she said she took a sleeping pill and felt as if her hart was racing and felt nauseous.  We had a nurse onboard, Elsvan Der Wesde.  He checked her paulse and pressure and also had called for a medic come out and check her out.
Ellen had said she was afraid of flying, the Nurse and medic felt she was just hyperventilating and had her breath into a bag.  They both felt she was then OK to fly.  We then departed for AMS and I was told by the purser she was OK and slept on the flight, we landed in AMS with no further incidents.

While fueling 752MA prior to departure from FLL on 10/22/11, the Flight Mechanic on flight 393 inadvertantly pressed the fuel override 
switches on the fueling panel. Tanks had just &quot;topped off&quot; and truck was still connected, however Flt Mx believed there was an error quantity 
reading on the fuel gauges, thereby providing an opportunity to take more fuel.

Several gallons of fuel (approx 5-7) from each wing spilled on to ramp and were subsequently cleaned by Sheltair line service in a quick and 
uneventful fashion."></attribute>

OPT data.
At approximately 2050Z Dispatch Manager sent an e-mail to ground handler to re-confirm that runway 06/24 would indeed be closed for departure of flight. Response was :yes, runway will be closed and flight will not be able to take off. E-mail sent to ground handler to advise the intent to use runway 13/31;
response :no runway will be open until 0600Z. Ground handler offered phone number for Airport Authority; phone call made to Airport Authority who confirmed runway 06/24 would be closed at 2200Z-0530Z and advised runway 13/31 was not avaiable, has been closed for several years. Decision made to operate at 0600Z. Captain was also in communication with the ground handler and receiving the same information as Dispatch.    "></attribute>

had found fluid on the ramp and suspected it was are aircraft.
We taxied back to the gate and shut down the engines. I left the cockpit to talk the agent and discus the problem, he showed me a spot on the 
ramp that he suspected to be fluid from are aircraft.
I preformed a visual inspection of are aircraft and found no leeks. I asked the first officer to take a look and see if I missed something, he 
found no leeks as well.  After reviewing are fluid levels and the results of my and the first officers visual inspection. I determined are aircraft 
was not loosing any fluid and continued the flight.
After 2:45hrs of flight time we arrived at are destination and the fluid levels remained the same. "></attribute>

RE:  Incident on Sheltair ramp in FLL

While on the ramp in FLL, a non-qualified employee of Miami Air, Luigi Imbrieco operated the environmental system in the aircraft without permission.
A ground air condition cart was hooked up to N753MA.  I had configured the system controls by following the Boeing and the Company FAA approved procedures in accordance with my training (Supplementary Procedure section of the AOM (SP 2.1)).  After completing this procedure, I noticed a person suddenly reaching into the flight deck and hastily flipping switches.  I jumped up to discover Mr. Imbrieco had turned off the recirculation fans on the overhead panel.  Mr. Imbrieco then told me that I am â€œnot doing it correctlyâ€.  I then emphatically informed Mr. Imbrieco never touch anything in the cockpit again.  I added that I had followed the Company procedure correctly.
"></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="A short while after this event, I approached Mr. Imbrieco to ask him if he was a mechanic or if he had gotten permission from our mechanic to operate the system controls.  His response was to repeatedly tell me that I do not understand the system.
This event is of concern because Mr. Imbrieco is not a pilot, mechanic nor has he been trained to operate controls on a B737.  A non-qualified person operating aircraft systems without proper training poses a safety risk.  In his haste, he could have operated the wrong system, such as the hydraulic system with the tow bar connected.  If the bypass pin was not in, this could have been disastrous. 
By the tone of our follow up conversation and Mr. Imbriecoâ€™s lack of cooperation, it is my belief that he has done this before.  Further, I presume he would not have told the crew that he had altered the systems configuration.  He was not receptive to my handling of the situation and so I believe he will continue to function in this unsafe manner in the future.

We were not adivsed of the closure until after we had departed. Even if we had followed the schedule, we did not have the fuel to hold the extra time.

I notified ATC and told them we may have had a possible nose gear tire blowout on take-off.  They later confirmed that there was rubber on the runway.  Declared an emergency and contacted the company.  A joint decision was made to divert to MIA.

While on approach into MIA, hydraulic pump ENG 1 LOW PRESSURE light illuminated and we verified hydraulic quantity was decreasing on the lower DU.  Followed QRH procedures and landed safely.

Captain Miguel Martin was given warning of ground delay in writing along with a copy of the ground delay printout with the weather and notams update package. Dispatch was flight following with no signs that they might divert. During 5 mile final, a focused and hurried Captain Martin called in that he wil divert to CLE due to 1 issue. A high windshear advisory that was given to him by the control tower. It was later found out he had min fuel and could not hold. I believe he landed in CLE with 1.9.

Actual FDP 16+00 (Ending at Aircraft Block-in Time)

During Flight Segment 2 (OGG to RIV) I believe I may have become fatigued due to the long duty day and due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.

Fatigue set in also in part due to the Miami Air APC delegated seats do not satisfy the requirements of a Class 3 rest facility and are less than adequate.


FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on 30APR12 thru 01MAY12.

FAR 117.17 Flight Duty Period: Augmented flight crew
Table C
Scheduled Time of Start (1530L)
Number of Flight Segments (2)
Number of Pilots (3)
Less than Class Three Rest Facility

MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD (For Class Three Rest Facility) = 14+00
MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD Table B (due to Lack of Class Three Rest Facility) = 12+00
15+00 scheduled FDP exceeded this limitation; 16+00 Actual FDP exceeded this limitation

Miami Air B737â€™s pilots rest facility does not qualify as a Class Three Rest Facility

For Reference: Class 3 rest facility means a seat in an aircraft cabin or flight deck that
reclines at least 40 degrees and provides leg and foot support.

Please Note
As a reference towards the progress of Miami Air complying with FAR 117
I would like to include the following:

Beginning in January of 2012 under the new unenforceable regulation FAR 117, I have now completed 26 FDPâ€™s (Flighty Duty Periods) as a pilot in flight.

Of the 26 FDPâ€™s thus far 12 of them have exceeded limitations as established in FAR 117.

The following cases as acclimated and augmented:

Actual FDP 13+50 (Ending at Aircraft Block-in Time)

During Flight Segment 3 (OKC to IND) I believe I may have become fatigued due to the long duty day and due to being scheduled by the company beyond limitations as established by FAR 117.

FAR 117 Limitations exceeded by the FDP on 25MAR12 thru 26MAR12.

FAR 117.17 Flight Duty Period: Augmented flight crew
Table C
Scheduled Time of Start (1200L)
Number of Flight Segments (3)
Number of Pilots (3)
Less than Class Three Rest Facility

MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD (For Class Three Rest Facility) = 15+00
MAX FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD Table B (due to Lack of Class Three Rest Facility) = 13+00
13+20 scheduled FDP exceeded this limitation; 13+50 Actual FDP exceeded this limitation

Miami Air B737â€™s pilots rest facility does not qualify as a Class Three Rest Facility

For Reference: Class 3 rest facility means a seat in an aircraft cabin or flight deck that
reclines at least 40 degrees and provides leg and foot support.

Please Note
As a reference towards the progress of Miami Air complying with FAR 117
I would like to include the following:

Beginning in January of 2012 under the new unenforceable regulation FAR 117, I have now completed 18 FDPâ€™s (Flighty Duty Periods) as a pilot in flight.

Of the 18 FDPâ€™s thus far 9 of them have exceeded limitations as established in FAR 117.

The following cases as acclimated and augmented:

(25 thru 26MAR12) FDP Scheduled total 13+20, Report 1200L, 3 Flight segments, Actual FDP total 13+50
Due to Lack of a Class 3 Rest Facility

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Our driver was from M.G. As soon as he pulled off he was about to miss the first stop sign because he was driving very fast out of the parking lot. He slammed on his brakes whereas, the van slide a little.
He proceeded to speed as we were heading towards the highway. On the highway he was speeding excessivly and he was losing control of the van on numerous ocassions because the van continue to leave its lane. At one point when he was entering the HOV express lane, he went past the lane and almost hit the cones while entering the HOV lane. At that point I told him and i quote &quot;Honey, you need to control your driving, I need to get home to my family safe and all in one piece&quot;. He  mumble something under his breath and continue to speed but did not lost control. This is my second time driving with this driver. The first time he picked me up from FLL airport and was exactly the same thing with the exception that he was driving extremely slow to the point that drivers were honking at him and giving him the finger because He was driving at that speed in the HOV express lane and never went over 45 mph. With that said, he was still losing control of the van and going over to the other lane. "></attribute>

I had three flights preparing to depart, although two were delayed due to late arriving pax. We contacted the ground handler after the a/c was enroute to advise they were early and were advised no problem. The ground handler called back at approximately 0210 local and advised the airport authority told him both runways were closed for taxiway repaving and would not be opened for our arrival. I contacted Sheltair in FLL and asked if they could handle the a/c. I also contacted the duty officer to advise of the situation. I spoke to the lead ground handler from Galaxy in PBI and he told me the crew and the buses were coming down to assist in pax transport to PBI. Sheltair was short on staffing and they would assist with offloading the pax bags with Sheltair's approval. "></attribute>

See Photo No 1.  The contractor had removed some of the poles, which had not been cut to be flush with the parking lot.  See Photo No. 2.  There was also a great deal of debris and it was windy.  The wind was blowing pieces of debris onto the north runway. See Photo No. 3.  Some of the pieces of debris while light in weight were large enough to cause damage to persons or property when blown about by the wind.  The debris could also be blown onto the runway and get sucked up into an engine.  See Photo No 4.  In the last photo you can see that the wind was often blowing so hard that it forced a large plastic cone under the fence.  All of the issues present a danger to air traffic, pedestrians, and vehicles.  I immediately brought this to the attention of our Director of Safety, who personally went down and cleaned up a great deal of the debris.  We also notified our POI Stanley Crum about this issue.  The Miami Dade Aviation Department was called.  They said the Commodor facility had contractors removing the fence.  Mr. Martinez insisted upon a work order being placed to get the debris properly clean up and the poles cut flush with the ground.  Work Order #215259.  "></attribute>

standby and ran the performance for departure. After checking the numbers were good we told him we could accept it. The tower cleared us 
for takeoff. As we taxied for takeoff the captain taxi straight towards the runway and made a slight turn to the right to follow by his left turn to 
align the aircraft with the center line,in the process the right main tire went into the grass where we came to a stop and shut the engines down. 
The aircraft remained there until they pulled us out. "></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Enroute cruise that started at FL 370. ATC was step descending the flight in 2,000 foot increments. Aircraft was level at FL 330. First Officer Kuyper was inclined to use the lavatory. Time frame was approximately 20 minutes prior to a normal time for Top of Decent. Auto pilot was engaged.
First Officer Kuyper returned from lavatory. Captain Nilsson and Flight Mechanic Ferrer were in cockpit. First Officer Kuyper had sat down, prepared himself to accept control of the aircraft, accepted control of the aircraft, and resumed his duties as Pilot Flying. Flight Mechanic Ferrer was in the process of extending the stowed jump seat. 
There was no Air Traffic Control or other aircraft reports of turbulence in our vicinity. The meteorological conditions did not indicate a possibility of turbulence.
Aircraft encountered Clear Air Turbulence. Almost instantaneously, the aircraft deviated approximately 100 feet low from assigned altitude. First Officer Kuyper maintained control of the aircraft and noted that the aircraft was returning to assigned altitude. Flight Mechanic Ferrer was injured during this event. The Seat Belt sign was not illuminated at the time of the event. Captain Nilsson illuminated the Seat Belt sign as soon as the event was recognized. The entire Clear Air Turbulence event lasted approximately 2 seconds.
Captain Nilsson called Purser Kerr after the event occurred to receive a cabin report. Captain Nilsson was called back and advised off injuries. No passengers were injured. All passengers were seated with seat belts fastened. Flight Attendants Rogers and Mahon were injured. 
Purser Kerr called Captain Nilsson stating that Flight Attendant Rogers had injured her leg and that there was a team doctor onboard. The doctor advised Purser Kerr that Flight Attendant Rogers will need a wheel chair and to have medical attention. Doctor informed Purser Kerr that Flight Attendant Rogers may have fractured or broken her ankle/foot. Captain Nilsson called flight operations on the SAT phone and advised operations of the event. Captain Nilsson requested that Flight Operations call the Fixed Base Operator in Norfolk (KORF) and have paramedics meet the aircraft at the ramp/parking area.
Captain Nilsson discussed the injuries with Flight Mechanic Ferrer and advised to have the paramedics attend him on the ground.
Captain Nilsson monitored the status of the Flight Attendant's injuries with Purser Kerr until just prior to sterile cockpit procedures took effect. 
Paramedics met the aircraft at the FBO ramp. The paramedics boarded, assessed Flight Attendant Rogers, and informed Captain Nilsson that she is stable. Captain Nilsson allowed the passengers to deplane. After the passengers were deplaned, the paramedics attended Flight Attendant Rogers, Flight attendant Mahon, and Flight Mechanic Ferrer. 
Flight Attendant Mahon and Flight Mechanic Ferrer both refused to go to the hospital. Paramedics removed Flight Attendant Rogers from the aircraft and took her to the hospital. "></attribute>

After the movie I began to walk back to the Hotel, the temperature had risen quite a bit and the heat index 
was over 100 degrees.  I stopped for water and ate a banana.  As I continued to walk, I finished my water 
and stopped at a service station for more.  The difference between the extremely hot air outside and the 
cool air inside gave me a &quot;head rush&quot; and I felt a little dizzy.  I was sweating profusely and when I reached 
for a counter to steady myself, my hand slipped and I fell to the floor hitting my head on the edge of the 
counter resulting in a cut over my left eye."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="On Oct 18th, prior to descend into ORF (LL351) area, AC 733  at FL 330 experienced clear air 
turbulence. The first officer came from the fwd lavatory and the time he sat down and secure his seat 
belts, we all notice in the cockpit that the AC started to oscillate up and down. Quickly, the rough area and 
turbulence started. It was very quick. I did not have time to seat down due to the previous transit from FO 
to occupy his seat, and I could not unfold the OBS seat to seat myself.
As a result of it, I started to bounce up and down inside the cockpit to the point that my RH knee hit the 
RH book self corner underneath the OBS seat. The turbulence ended and I was on the cockpit floor. The 
pain was intense for about the entire descend until landing. The front end crew was OK, they were 
secured with belts on.
The back end crew was hurt, names of Mary R., H. Ferrell, and Claudia M. were few of them. Purser gave 
me ice before landing.
The ORF paramedics showed. After taking care of the hurt FA, one of them came to me and asked me 
few questions related to the incident. I received a band aid.
I put a lot of ice due to pain. Also I took 2 advils for pain. I noticed that during next flight ORF-UNV (LL 
511) I was on pain still."></attribute>

While on approach, landing gear would not come down and declared a emergency.  Did not get into my hotel room until 2:00 am local time.  Woke up 5 later and started coordinating crew and passenger to get to aircraft for 11:00 am show.

Dead headed to AMS.  Luggage was lost in AMS.  Got to hotel at 6:00 am. Lugged luggage up 3 flights of stairs.  No air conditioning in room could not take a nap.  Transfer to new hotel at 12:00 pm.  Got to hotel 2:00 pm ish.  Rooms where not ready. Unpack, and settle in and ate a early dinner.

Try to go to bed around 8:00 PM, had a hard time getting to sleep.  Woke the next day at 1:30 AM for at 3:15 AM show.

First leg was I was just tired by the end of the return leg I was exhausted.

 Narrative:

There was numerous safety violations conducted on this one day trip.

Our briefings clearly indicated direction for safety to be the number one goal at Shell Oil.

Miami Air FOM Bulletin 12-04 states:
The purpose of this bulletin is to address the additional policies and procedures specific to this contract and the additional restrictions for operations into PASC.

Under Duty and Rest Limitations of this bulletin it states:
Shell has established the following duty and rest limitations over and above Miami Airâ€™s FAR and contractual limitations:

â€¢	Max flight duty period of 14 hours. Can be extended to 16 hours with a duty break (day room) of at least 3 hours.
â€¢	Max 190 duty hours in a 28 day period. Includes standby time.

Both of these limitations established over and above Miami Airâ€™s FAR and contractual limitations were violated on this one day trip.


Flight duty period (FDP) is defined by current FARâ€™s to mean:
A period that begins when a flightcrew member is required to report for duty with the intention of conducting a flight, a series of flights, or positioning or ferrying flights, and ends when the aircraft is parked after the last flight and there is no intention for further aircraft movement by the same flightcrew member. A flight duty period includes the duties performed by the flightcrew member on behalf of the certificate holder that occur before a flight segment or between flight segments without a required intervening rest period. Examples of tasks that are part of the flight duty period include deadhead transportation, training conducted in an aircraft or flight simulator, and airport/standby reserve, if the above tasks occur before a flight segment or between flight segments without an intervening required rest period.

Duty is defined by current FARâ€™s to mean:
Any task that a flightcrew member performs as required by the certificate holder, including but not limited to flight duty period, flight duty, pre- and post-flight duties, administrative work, training, deadhead transportation, aircraft positioning on the ground, aircraft loading, and aircraft servicing.

The FDP completed this trip was 16+25 hrs.
The Duty completed in the past 28 days after this trip 193+47 hrs.
(please note that only Miami Air Short Call standby or as what the FARâ€™s delineate as Reserve availability period is used in this calculation) Additional time would have to be added if Shell Oil considers standby time to include Miami Airâ€™s long call standby.

Here is the data to support excess duty in the past 28 days.

11AUG duty completed 08+35
10AUG duty completed 08+45, total 17+20 (10&amp;11AUG continual duty across zulu day)

02AUG duty completed 05+55, total 23+15
01AUG duty completed 10+55
31JUL duty completed 05+00, total 38+20 (31JUL&amp;01AUG continual duty across z day)

16JUL duty completed 05+30, total 187+37 (16&amp;17JUL continual duty across zulu day)
15JUL duty completed 06+10, total 193+47


Our operation conducted on 10AUG12 into 11AUG12 (the zulu day) mostly all on 10AUG local Alaska time was in violation of the FDP (flight duty period) limitations as provided by Shell Oil and in violation of enforceable FAR duty time limits under part 121.

After a mostly uneventful flight #820 ANC to BRW our crew were transported to Shell Oilâ€™s man camp. This was a dayroom with dining and rest facilities and other services.

The crew assembled at around 0100z to 0115z for transport from the BRW dayroom to the aircraft. When we returned to the passenger terminal we received word that the aircraft battery switch was left on and that the aircraft battery was dead. Captain Lane specifically told the FAâ€™s that they could remain in the passenger terminal because there was no heat on the aircraft. After only a couple of minutes the FAâ€™s elected to go out to the plane to get ready and prepare for flight #824, it appeared that they initially were willing to wait on a cold aircraft while maintenance would be performed to restore battery power.

During the attempt to re-charge the battery this process began to take a long time.
We were due to block out at 0230z and after some time charging the battery it became clear that we would not get out on time. For the most part our 5 passengers remained patient. At some point in time the passengers were boarded and an attempt to start the #1 engine from a ground air cart was made. The engine did light off and begin to run up but before starter cutoff the electrical power in the plane went out and we were forced to shut-off fuel to the start because of no indications in the cockpit on this engine.

The passengers were then let off the plane. Sometime later an Alaska airline B737 arrived and the passengers got word that it was scheduled to depart to ANC. They elected to leave the Shell Oil passenger terminal and go to Alaska airlines terminal to leave on that flight. Alaska airlines records indicate that flight AS#52 blocked out of BRW at (2046L) 0446z.

After our passengers left and that we noticed the Alaska flight departed the captain became concerned that we may exceed flight duty time restraints. We were already bumping up against the 14 hour limitation but due to the dayroom we would be allowed to go to 16 hrs.

Therefore it could be determined that in order for the max of 14 to be extended to 16 we would have needed to block out by 0715z and still be good to plan to block in for the scheduled 2+00 hr block flight at 0915z. A planned Block-in time at ANC of 0915z would place us at exactly 16+00 Flight duty period.

However as minutes turned into hours and hours on into the next waiting a good portion of the time on the aircraft in freezing cold temperatures re-charging the aircraft battery it became apparent as we were getting closer to 0715z that we would probably have to stay in BRW.

After realizing a problem existed in the fact that we had not reset the battery charger circuit breaker and the reason we may had not be getting a good re-charge on the battery could have been due to this. Therefore despite the fact that we were now very, very close to the time of 0715z the captain chose to see how well the charge was doing after the mistake. I believe that he felt that he would be able to get a good charge on the battery after the mistake was corrected and that he would be able to maintain a good air cart start once the battery made it up to his desired voltage. The result was just this, however we had a problem in that the attempt to start the #1 engine this second time was done after 0715z. We indicated that we blocked out at 0740z from BRW, which was too late to be in compliance with Shellâ€™s mandate.

I felt intimidated by Captain Lane and with the presence of Javier Ferrer (a designated Jumpseater not dispatched for flight duties) not to object to completing operations beyond the limitations established by Shell Oil. Despite Shell Oil briefings that authorize any person even low on the totem pole permission to shut operations down for suspected safety concerns, I did not feel comfortable at Miami Air to do this. I was worried that if I refused to go beyond the 16 hours duty or even 16 hours flight duty period that a possibility existed that Javier Ferrer would be dispatched by the company to fly the crew home on flight #824 and leave me in Barrow alone in arguably some sort of trouble with the company if I did so. I felt that I was in a tight spot. 

When asked by the Captain of my opinion in BRW. I explained that we should just return to ANC in the morning.

The reality is that a lot more happened including pressure by the Captain to consider resetting the clock by returning to the day room and count a rest period utilizing the block-in time at BRW of 1940z (10AUG12). When confronted by the Captain about such and idea I refused to answer and to my best recollection I may have shrugged my shoulders. He explained to me that we could plan a block-out time of around (2340L) which in turn comes out to be 0740z. When looking up the FOM bulletin there are conditions where Shell Oil permits the 12 hr rest period to be reducible to 11 hrs if the accommodations are within 30 minutes as such was the case. The time of 0740z 11AUG12 minus the time of 1940z 10AUG12 equals 12 hrs. After reviewing these numbers I believe the captain was considering granting the crew a 12 hour rest vice an 11 hour rest to begin at our BRW Block-in time. If we would have conducted such actions we would have clearly violated duty time constraints as it is difficult for any certificate holder to justify requiring a crew member to report for duty then after some time, and in this case about 4-5 hours of waiting, not count the duty involved in waiting for an up aircraft.

Also in that dayâ€™s mess included pressure by FAâ€™s that clearly had get-home to ANC itus.
They did not want to stay in Barrow.

The working conditions were appalling due to the fact that the plan return trip was spent mostly in freezing cold weather with no APU nor heat on the N752MA aircraft.

One can clearly see that we completed 16+40 hrs duty in accordance with the Miami Air report procedures.

Since Shell indicates by the FOM bulletin a limit on the FDP vice Miami Airâ€™s trip sheet duty, you will find the FDP completed was 16+25 hrs.

And we really didnâ€™t block out at 0740z because it was actually 5-10 minutes later.

My frustration after reaching the hotel after 17+20 hrs was not only because we violated FAA Regs as well as Shell requirements but also because of many other safety violations.

Some of my frustrations were because of procedural issues in conducting an approach to BRW in instrument conditions. While cleared to 2000 ft direct to LEDHO the following occurred after clearance to fly the 16 DME arc and clearance to fly the LOC DME (back crs) RWY 25 to PABR/BRW. The captain flew the leg. We intercepted the final approach course at approximately 11.9 DME as we were unable to maintain the 16 DME arc. While in a nice turn intercepting the Final approach course the captain selected VOR/LOC and the FMA captured the VOR/LOC but began what appeared like an immediate turn to the right yet the auto-pilot may have only been taking out the original left turn applied that was capturing the Final approach course nicely. As a result the captain de-selected the VOR/LOC function engaged V/S to descend to 1700â€™ and tried to redirect the heading to center up the final approach course. While we stayed within the Final approach course limits of the HSI course that was dialed in 071 degrees, we never centered the course until sometime later in visual conditions. I called JISTU 1740 ft crossing the Final Approach Fix and shortly thereafter we went to full scale deflection of the HSI to the left. The captain decided to dive the aircraft at approximately 1100-1200 fpm with the full scale deflection in an attempt to break through the reported 600 overcast ceiling to find the runway before the MAP. We did break through the overcast layer and when we did so I reported the runway in sight. I continued in visual conditions to report the 100 ft above minimums until the captain reported his visual to the runway as procedure established by Miami Air. My safety concerns were that the captain had difficulty flying the 16 DME arc, went to full scale deflection inside the FAF and failed to execute a missed approach, and then decided to dive the aircraft to break through the overcast before the MAP while not in protected airspace.

Some of my frustrations were because of maintenance issues that occurred on the ground after arrival in BRW. The maintenance issues on the ground were related to the dead battery as previously described. However, I would like to add that I am uncertain as to whether proper charging procedures were applied to get the dead battery re-charged. Our AOM has a procedure that calls for a 28V dc source to re-charge the battery and I believe we only used a 115V DC power source. This is probably why after the captain reset the Battery charger circuit breaker very late in the duty day that we were able to get a good charge on the battery. My safety concern was because proper procedure was not followed on the re-charge.

Some of my frustrations were because a Non-dispatched pilot (a Jumpseater) was allowed to fly portions of the leg BRW to ANC. This I was not certain was in compliance with what Northern Air Cargo and Shell Oil may or may not object to.

In addition to a frustrating day for all crew members I was very tired, cold, hungry and fatigued throughout most of the evening there in Barrow. My feet literally didnâ€™t get warm until arrival into ANC, where the reported temperature was 14 C. And I was especially fatigued upon arrival at the Fairfield INN at 1235am (0035L) 11AUG 12 after 17+20 hours.

Lastly, upon my departure from the Hotel in Anchorage as requested by Northern Air Cargo I was approached by Captain Lane while boarded to the hotel shuttle-bus. He came up to me to say goodbye. Then just as he began walking away he said â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€

I was puzzled and I exclaimed â€œsorry?, for what?â€

He said â€œbecause you have to go.â€

I said â€œBob.â€

He said â€œWhat?â€

I asked â€œDonâ€™t you think it would have been best to have returned from Barrow in the morning?â€

He said â€œYep.â€

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="It was presented to me that an EFB needed to be created and released as soon as possible because an EFB was DMI'd only because of a search feature not working in one of the manuals (FOM) in the unit.

I suggested waiting for the next release which would be released in 3 days to release the fix and DMI-ing an EFB only because of a search feature was not necessary. To clarify, the EFB still works perfectly fine, its just the search feature that had an issue.

A Read File was created (RF 1149) and posted without my knowledge that the EFB unit should not be DMI'd because of a search feature in a manual not working. I then received word directly from the Chief Pilot, Miguel Martin that the EFB being DMI'd was useless and was not required to have an EFB released just for one manual. Since I am responsible for taking orders directly from my supervisor, I informed him via email and asked for clarification since I am primarily responsible for releasing EFB's and should know whats going on. Although the new EFB set that was set to release on 7/16/2015 with an addition updated bulletin to the FOM, I was ordered to still proceed with the old release to fix the search issue. Employee's responsible for shipping and handling of the EFB work orders were not too happy about the release going out so soon and including myself think it was not only a waste of time but also a waste of money.

I personally think that this could have been properly handled if there was better communication and having confidence in employee's recommendations which are notorious to be ignored company-wide. In this case, I am told by my supervisor to do one thing, while someone in hire authority asked me something else (something that I initially suggested), then my supervisor proceeds to tell me to do something different. 

Lack in communication is not only unfair to employees but it could result in safety issues, unnecessary cost, and additional work/task to be done that is not actually required. Additionally, when someone ask another immediate employee a question about an item in the department &quot;I don't know, you have to ask [xyz]&quot; should not be a response 99% of the times. We have had incidents in the past, where we not only embarrassed ourselves in front of the FAA but were hammered for similar issues, yet it still continues."></attribute>

The throttles were moved to 40% N1 and the aircraft started its takeoff roll.  The captain (myself) called 40% N1.   The First Officer pushed the TOGA button and called &quot;N1, HDG SEL, TOGA, check thrust&quot;.  Within seconds the takeoff warning sounded the first officer pulled the throttles to idle and I took control of the aircraft.  We taxied off of the runway at &quot;Bravo&quot; taxiway.  We checked the aircraft configuration (Flaps were 1, Stab in the green band LEDs extended, green light, no parking brake, SB handle down, no spoilers up) and pushed both throttles up several times and no takeoff warning horn.  Second takeoff was normal."></attribute>

perform the required task of the exist row. F/A Kadirbaks asked the lady to move to a non exist row. The lady's husband had an issue with the 
request and verbally threatened F/A Kadirbaks by telling his wife to hit the flight attendant. After several time of telling his wife, other 
passengers started to back up F/A Kadirbaks. The family did finally move to a different row.

After the incident F/A Kadirbaks came to the flight deck and requested to have the police meet the airplane at the gate in AMS. So, she would 
have the option to press charges against the verbally threatening passenger if she chose to.  I called Ops(131.4) to request security to meet 
the flight upon arrival.

The police meet the airplane at gate G05 in AMS and escorted the verbally threatening passenger off the airplane. After the rest of the 
passengers had deplaned, I asked the police officer if we (MAI crew members) needed to give any statements? The officer said &quot;no and we 
were free to carry on with our normal duties.&quot;"></attribute>

Aviation, a Part 145 Repair Station.  The partially undeclared box was somehow placed in the cargo hold of 
N739MA and flown for five legs.  While the aircraft was in Norfolk, VA.  Mr. Dimitry Pigne, a Tech Rep for 
Miami Air, found the box while looking for tools.  Mistakenly, Mr. Pigne, shipped the box without inspecting 
the contents to the Miami Air stockroom via two day FedEx, undeclared on April 16, 2013.  The box was 
received by Mr. Joe Benard at the stockroom, who upon receipt of the package realized that it had been 
shipped improperly.  Ms. Maria Jimenez, Director of Purchasing/Stores, began an investigation of the 
shipping history of the package.  All shipping labels were secured, pictures taken (see attachments to this 
report).  Mr. Pigne wrote a letter of apology to Mr. Walter Iwanenko, Director of Maintenance, accepting full 
responsibility for shipping the item partially undeclared.  "></attribute>

Waited for WX to improve in metar, but no improvment by 0800z. 
Consulted with duty officer, John Passwater at 0810z that the best option is to put the crew to rest.
Crew needed to be off STM by 0915z to be in MAO by 1030z to be legal, per crew scheduling

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="&quot;Out on the line for a couple of weeks in April and perhaps someone else other than me should look at a 
possible incident waiting to happen. 

Specifically, the maintenance utility ladders that are stored in the belly of the aircraft and used to access 
the pitot probe covers as well as to get into and out of the belly of the aircraft itself, are inadequate for 
the job.

The ladders are too short and the base of ladder is not wide enough causing an unstable reach and/or 
egress from the belly of the aircraft. This instability is in good weather and when you add gusty winds, 
rain and/or an icy tarmac,  think you will be asking for trouble. 
My opinion is that another two feet should be added to the ladder with a proportional base width 
increase, so as not to be using the last rung of the ladder in reaching up, or in the case of cargo area, 
stepping down from the bay.&quot;

September 2013.  Apparently Captain Lane, contradictory to company policy, decided to turn off the No 
Smoking Sign in the Passenger cabin on almost every live flight, shortly after takeoff.  On the first 
occurrence, the cabin crew asked if it was a Smoking flight because none of the flight attendants were on 
the smoking flight volunteer list.  Additionally, the passengers on that first flight had all been drinking 
heavily 
and there was confusion from the passengers as well. The captain responded that he did not want the 
lights 
from the signs interfering with the movie and stated that, like the Airbus, we are turning them off after 
takeoff.  This non-compliance with procedures continued for the rest of the month, to the point where it 
became a joke among the crew to &quot;light 'em up&quot; after each takeoff."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="once_the_event_was_identified" value="After determining that all systems were normal I called maintenance control to describe the noise we heard during gear retraction. They informed the duty officer and in a follow up call informed me that it was their opinion that there no cause for alarm. It was only a 47 minute flight and with no indications of an identifiable problem and no guidance from our QRH there was no reason not to land in ALB. I still had concerns that there was some kind of problem with the nose wheel, possibly a deflated tire. In the interest of safety, I explained the situation to the approach controller and asked that the emergency vehicles be on standby for our arrival. This constituted declaring an emergency. ATC suggested a flyby of the Tower to visually verify the status of the nose gear. The gear was extended and locked down with all normal indications. We accomplished the flyby; the Tower verified that everything appeared normal. We left the gear in the down and locked position and returned for a normal landing. On landing the nose shimmied a little but was very much controllable. An inspection of the gear after landing revealed that the left nose wheel tire had deflated and had some cuts in it accounting for the noise we heard during retraction."></attribute>

Increasing heartbeat, difficulty in breathing, tightness in teh chest, losing feeling in his arms and legs and intermittent responsiveness.  The passenger, Sean McCormick, needed immediate medical assistance.  We declared a medical emergency and diverted to KMCO, the nearest major airport.  Medical assistance and ground handling was arranged with coordinations through Dispatch.  After landing the passenger was treated and taken to the hospital by medical personnel.  Two on-board reps accompanied him, Pax Peter Forkner and Brandon White.
After an overweight landing inspection by Maintenance and the log-book write-up cleared, we continued to BOS without further incident."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="We were parked at North Cargo 3 (BOS) undergoing servicing of the aircraft at the time of the event. 
Passengers had been deplaned, equipment offloaded, and the aircraft fueled. A request was made to have 
the lavs fully dumped to facilitate the winterization process as we were scheduled to fly to YYZ for an 
overnight. At 7:15, I was in the back of the airplane with several of my flight attendants when we felt 
something impact the aircraft. There was a loud bang as the plane shook wildly for several seconds 
accompanied by sounds of screeching metal. I immediately ran off the airplane down the airstairs on to the 
tarmac. Seeing nothing to the left, I ran around the front of the aircraft to the right side where I saw a body 
sprawled out on the ground behind the right engine &amp; Hector Ortega (Mech) running towards Pat Marz (Co 
Rep) and myself screaming for someone to call 911. I raced back up the airstairs to the aircraft. At 7:16 I 
placed a call to 911 and instructed F/O De LaRosa to call ground control and relay the situation to 
MassPort and instructed everyone else to remain onboard. Police, Fire/Rescue, Paramedics et al arrived 
on scene a couple minutes later."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="While I can only speculate, what I think happened is this. One Signature employee was backing a lavatory 
service truck up to aircraft left as another man was marshalling him in to position. The driver may have left 
the vehicle in Reverse thinking in fact he had put it in Park. Attempting to get out of the truck and with it still 
moving, he probably panicked and accidentally slammed on the gas pedal, instantly ramming into the 
marshaller, the underside tail end of the aircraft through to the other side coming to a rest about 30-40 feet 
off to aircraft right. On a side note, I do not recall seeing extra wheel chocks lying on the ground near 
where the lavatory truck normally would have been parked."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="For years I have sat down in the front middle desk at Dispatch office.
There is a air condition vent (which has mold spores growing from it). I have asked again and again for this vent to be cleaned and a filter put in it. Finally after nagging for many years  Miami Dade came (6years ago)  put a filter in this particular vent. It has been a long while and no filter has been ever replaced.

When I walk into our Dispatch office after of a couple of hours of being there my throat starts to bother me. Or I sneeze, or my eyes start to cry. This is a very unhealthy environment to work and give your best performance.

All of this can be confirmed by just looking up at the vent. Also in the back room where the refrigerator is the vent is blowing black mold particles. Again this is a very unhealthy environment. I am very concerned for myself and my co-workers health.

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="This is regarding a safety concern that has occurred a few times in the past and continuously happens to that point I feel it should be addressed. This remains a concern to me because it puts my life and the lives others in great danger.

For some reason, someone (most likely, the contractors) almost always continue to leave the Aircraft stair railing completely open (e.g., Pic 2 and 4 ) OR occasionally, create what I call: a Bear Pit where they, leave the stair pulled away away from the aircraft (1 to 3 feet away) while the door remains open (e.g., Pic 1, 3, 4 and 5). If someone does not pay close attention to this they WILL fall right through the opening. 

I want to clearly state that Luigi, Reniel, and Eddie are always very good at keeping an eye on safety issues and, from my personal experience, always address the matter immediately when it goes mentioned. However, I also notice that safety issue are higher when we have contractors are working on the ramp. In regards to the stair, to rectify the matter, I personally asked the nearest worker (so happened to be a contractor) &quot;if [he] could assist me in moving the stair closer to the aircraft since it was a safety concern&quot;. His response was â€œAre you going up to the aircraft?â€ and â€œnot to worry about it because nobody is inside the aircraftâ€. With my experience, I don't really think contractors are concerned or care about keeping areas safe. After all, they are not full time Miami Air employees.

had just had work done on #1 engine to replace 5 fan blades and engine re-rigged to within limits to more 
closely match acceleration with the other engine, and that, upon takeoff thrust settings, the bleed system 
developed big split in bleed air pressure (causing #1 engine Bleed Air Trip Off), but that upon reduction of 
thrust from takeoff power to normal climb power, the pressure differential would reduce and the bleed trip 
would reset.  Maintenance indicated that no maintenance action - diagnostic, preventative, or corrective - 
was taken regarding the bleed system issue prior to the flight.  At takeoff (&lt; 100' AGL) the #1 engine Bleed 
Air tripped off (w/ associated #1 engine &quot;Bleed Trip Off&quot; and &quot;Master Caution&quot; lights illuminating).  On climb 
out, after selecting VNAV for the climb thrust setting, the #1 engine Bleed was reset utilizing the &quot;Trip 
Reset&quot; button.  Cabin appeared to be pressurizing normally on climb out.  Aircraft was cleared toward the 
north (direct VVMAX on Hedly One RNAV SID) and issued series of step climbs to integrate with crossing 
traffic as necessary.  On three separate instances during the climb out, the #1 engine Bleed Trip Off light 
illuminated and was reset per QRH procedures.  On each occasion, the bleed air pressure differential was 
significant (L Bleed Air 12psi, R Bleed Air 54psi).  Although the last climb clearance issued by ATC was to 
climb to FL350, PIC asked for, and granted permission to stop the climb at FL310 in order to monitor cabin 
pressure.  At FL310, the #1 Engine Bleed tripped off again -- again with the big psi differential noted 
previously, and it was determined that the aircraft would not hold 8000' cabin altitude (cabin altitude 
indicated as high as 9000') and that flying at lower altitudes would place the aircraft in, not over, weather 
buildups present in the direction of the planned flightpath, as well as those forecast enroute to KCLT.  PIC 
decided to return to KMIA and ATC rerouted N752MA back to KMIA without further incident."></attribute>

Travel and Crew Scheduling scheduled a LIMO from UNV to PIT to be followed by a commercial to ATL and MIA.  The van that picked up the crew had no seat belts available in the two benches of the van.  Only the front passenger seat had a seat belt available.  Belts were either tied up and unusable and/or were missing.  Road conditions were poor mainly caused by the snow storm that had passed by the day/evening prior.  Weather reported at UNV at 2:55 AM was calm, 5.0 miles vis, light snow, overcast skies.  Weather reported at PIT at 4:07 AM was light winds, 0.5 miles vis, light drizzle, mist.  The forecast for PIT during the drive was 1.o miles vis, light freezing drizzle, mist.  Ice was accumulating on the van throughout the three hour drive.  Half way through the drive, the driver had to stop for fuel and to clear the wipers and windows from ice build up.  Rear view mirrors were unusable due to ice build up.
The drive way scheduled for 3:15 AM Local.  The roads had not all been cleared/treated and we encountered snow plows still trying to clear the roads during the drive.  The driver never wore his own seat belt at any time.  Driver also had approximately six or seven cell phones mounted to the dashboard around the steering wheel, one of which was used (iPhone) as a screen to display music videos which were played over the van's speakers.
The van drive was in icy conditions, at night, in a vehicle without proper safety devices (seat belts)."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Dispatching and release went according to plan. Aircraft was departing at the time of shift turnover. After the shift turnover, I looked up one last time before walking out the doors and noticed that the aircraft had made a u turn and was at about 9000 feet. I told the new dispatcher on duty that we should call the ground handling station to find out what was going on. The ground handling station said that the aircraft was doing a air turn back because  they could not hold cabin pressure. I informed maintenance on duty that there was an air turn back and I informed the new dispatcher on duty, he gave me a nod to tell me he had it under control as the second dispatcher came in for and I left for the day."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Myself and the crew were being transported from the Miami Air office to Punta Gorda airport (PGD).  The van departed at 1am LCL and was scheduled to arrive at 4am.  The driver was cruising at speeds upwards of 80 MPH across Alligator Alley and north on I-75 between Naples and Punta Gorda, at night, which in my opinion was too fast and unsafe for a high profile vehicle.  He also failed to slow down through construction areas near Fort Myers and was swerving out of his lane. In areas where the road was not illuminated by street lights, he should have used his high beams and did not, ever.  The driver was displaying signs of fatigue as we got closer to our destination because he was swerving in and out of his lane.  I asked him on a couple of occasions if he was feeling alright.  The point is I should have been able to rest on my way to the airport as I was scheduled to operate a flight departing at 6am but could not, due to the erratic and unsafe driving."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="I believe the event occurred because the driver is not properly trained and may have been fatigued."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="avoiding_recurrence_of_this_event" value="It is not my intention to reprimand or accuse any one particular driver of poor or unsafe driving.  This is an issue that has occurs frequently and with different drivers, particularly on long trips.  If pilots are held to account by operating aircraft at high levels of safety to ensure the safety of their passengers, then the drivers and equipment that transport the crews to and from the airports should be held to the same standards.

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="This is an anonymous report received on Miami Air's Business Ethics on March 8th, 17:18.

[unknown caller]: &quot;Today is march 8th, 2014.  My complaint is concerning stock clerks, director purchasing, VP (mx), director of HR.

The reason why clerks leave is becuse whenever they go complain, it seems to get back to the VP of maintenance.  We figured that one out because the VP of maintenance and director of HR are friendly.  They are good friends.  I don't know but ethics it seems, applies to other people, but does not apply to management.  That's why people leave, not because of money.  Because soon as they go complain, the deck gets stacked against them and they have to go look @ the job boards or get _________ [swiped?, wiped?]  I think you should look in house first...&quot;

There was a second message from the same caller, but the connection was noisy, broken and we were not able to understand enough to make sense of it."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="On Tuesday, August 19, 2014, Mr. Curtis Gravett approached me with an ethics complaint.  He claimed that he was being singled out by his manager and that he was sent  to travel (work)  to Amsterdam on his days off without getting compensated for them in terms of time nor was he paid for the extra days he worked.

On Wednesday, August 20th, Mr. Gravett and I went to set up an appointment with Human Resources to discuss the issue.

On Thursday, August 21, 2014, a meeting was held between Mr. Gravett, Tom Ostendorp (the Vice President of Maintenance), Mirella Quadri (Director of Human Resources) and myself, acting as the companyâ€™s Ethics Compliance Officer.

At the end of the meeting, it was decided that the matter will be elevated to Mr. Jim Proia, President/CEO of Miami Air.

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Our crew had to clear customs at GAC building in MIA.  As we were walking on the sidewalk that leads to the GAC building (North Side of the Building), there was an area on the sidewalk that had a thin puddle of water and also a thin puddle of a slimy substance (possibly dirt, mud or algae).  As we were walking in line, the F/O (Mr. Phillip Cameron) was walking behind me.  He slipped in the mentioned area on the sidewalk and lost his footing, falling on his side.  When I turned around, he was lying on the ground on his side.  The flight mechanic (Mr. John Esposito) and I assisted him in getting him back on his feet.  He seemed okay, but a little disoriented as he did hit the side of his face on the sidewalk when he fell.  I also saw blood coming from his right hand.  Both his index finger and middle finger were swollen.

From conversation with Cpt. Carballosa on 12/18 at the safety office:

Mr. Alejandro Torres of MDAD assisted the crew at the moment.
After the event, crew cleared customs.
Cpt. Carballosa spoke with Mr. Dino Leonardi of Miami Dade Airport (305-876-7486) who said he would write a report.  He took the crew's information and suggested for the crew to call Fire Rescue.
Crew was then taken to MAI hangar, where it waited for Fire Rescue.
Fire Rescue came and examined Mr. Cameron.  They took his vitals, cleaned his fingers and bandaged him.  They also suggested for Mr. Cameron to go to urgent care clinic or emergency room.
Cpt. Carballosa drove F/O Cameron to Baptist Urgent Care facility in Doral (NW 41st street)
F/O Cameron received tetanus shot and x-ray and was then released.

Two days later, F/O Cameron reported his injured hand swollen and visited doctor.  The wound was infected.  The doctor prescribed antibiotics."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="I previously left for a trip Sunday, August 24 where I deadheaded to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The next day, 
August 25, I flew a 2 pilot ferry from Milwaukee (MKE) to Gander, Newfoundland (YQX) and then on to 
Groningen, Netherlands (GRQ). Due to the late inbound flight, my duty day officially started at 3pm local and 
ended at approximately 11am local the next day. With no relief pilot, I work (~14 hrs) through the night 
without so much as a 5 minute break. Predictably, I sleep in 2 different spurts until my next show time, each 
lasting for between 3-4 hours. I'm tired.

On August 27, I show at 9am local for a live flight from Groningen (GRQ) to Gander (YQX). We depart GRQ, 
again with no relief pilot, fly another crossing and arrive in YQX at about 12:30pm local. We depart YQX, still 
in uniform, and deadhead back to Miami on the continuation of our live flight and block in at 5:05pm local. 
Some almost 90 minutes later I'm back at the office and informed, incredibly, that I'm to be on short call 
starting early the next morning. I'm very tired.

On August 28, I wake up and am advised via email that I'm on short call yet again the following morning. 
Shortly thereafter (9:51am) crew scheduling calls to assign me a 1pm report for a Curacao turn. My sleep 
that night was fair and I felt slightly better but I recognized the cumulative effects of fatigue creeping in. 
Knowing I was facing another 10 hour day, I nonetheless accept the assignment. I arrive home after my turn 
at approximately 12:30am, fall asleep by 1:30 and am up automatically by 7. I am exhausted, unequivocally 
fatigued, and can not safely accept another flight assignment if called upon again.
"></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="While the breadth of things that I feel should be considered are beyond the scope of whatever comments I 
leave here, I think common sense needs to prevail. Crew scheduling must take a rational approach to every 
trip or schedule it hands out. They need to look at the pilots most recent duty. In this case, adding the first 
short call assignment immediately following the overseas trip was imprudent. Adding the second was 
unreasonable. Moreover, it was dangerous. Its not enough to determine whether an &quot;assignment&quot; is legal or 
not. Safety must rule over all other factors.

INFORMATION AND TO PREPARE THE FLIGHT PLANS AND RELEASE FOR THE AFFECTED FLIGHTS. I WAS 
INFORMED BY THE MAINTENANCE CONTROLLER ON DUTY THAT THE MEL ITEM ON N752MA RESTRICTED 
OPERATIONS TO VMC AND WITHIN CIVIL TWILIGHT. TO ASCERTAIN WHAT TIME WAS CIVIL TWILIGHT FOR 
BUFFALO I WENT TO THE MIAMI AIR DISPATCH HOME PAGE AND SELECTED UNDER CALCULATORS TABLES 
AND CODES THE SUNSET,SUNRISE &amp; TWILIGHT CALCULATOR. THIS TOOK ME TO A PAGE WHERE IT APPEARED 
TO ME THAT THE LINK HAD EXPIRED. I CLICKED ON THE TAB THAT SAID &quot;CLICK HERE TO PROCEED TO THE 
AVIATION CAMERA PROGRAM WEB SITE&quot; JUST TO SEE WHERE IT WOULD TAKE ME. IT DIRECTED ME TO 
AVIATION CAMERAS HOME WERE I WAS ABLE TO SELECT THE SUNRISE/SUNSET CALCULATOR TAB. TO GET 
THE LAT/LONG FOR THE AFFECTED STATION BUFFALO (KBUF) I WENT TO THE NAVTECH PAGE 105 (AIRPORTS) 
TO GET THIS INFORMATION. I TRANSFERRED THE LAT/LONG TO THE SUNRISE/SUNSET/TWILIGHT CALCULATOR 
PAGE THEN SELECTED CALCULATE AND HANDED THE RESULT TO CATALINA DIAZ WHO INFORMED THE 
CAPTAIN OF THE CIVIL TWILIGHT TIME FOR BUFFALO. AFTER DEPARTURE WHICH WAS UNKNOWN UNTIL WE 
SAW IT ON THE FLIGHT TRACKER, WHILE I WAITED I HAPPEN TO LOOK AT THE CAMERA IN THE DISPATCH 
OFFICE AND SAW THAT IT WAS FAIRLY DARK OUTSIDE. THEN I SAW THE FLIGHT POPPED UP ON THE FLIGHT 
TRACKER WITH AN INITIAL ETA OF 0050Z FOR KBUF. I THEN GOT THE MEL AND SAW WHERE THERE WAS 
REFERENCE TO THE AMERICAN AIR ALMANAC, I ENTERED THIS IN GOOGLE AND IT BROUGHT ME TO A PAGE 
SUN OR MOON RISE/SET TABLE FOR ONE YEAR. I DECIDED TO USE JEPPESEN TO GET THE LAT/LONG FOR 
BUFFALO ONLY FOR COMPARISON. JEPPESEN GAVE ME A BETTER DISPLAY OF THE COORDINATES WHICH 
WHEN ENTERED INTO THE CALCULATOR IT GAVE ME A DIFFERENT CIVIL TWILIGHT TIME WHICH WAS NOW 44 
MINUETS LESS THAN THE TIME GIVEN TO THE CAPTAIN SWEITZER BEFORE HE DEPARTED TORONTO FOR THE 
17 MIN. FLIGHT."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="BSK8808 departed KJQF for KITH with forecast condition at landing minimums at the destination at the ETA.

Whilst en-route, dispatch monitored Metars and Specis for KITH and noted FG was not lifting.

Capt Lawson called via Arinc and advised that he was holding due to field conditions being below landing minimums.

Call was made to Alternate Station (KROC) advising of the possibility of a diversion.

Capt Lawson called back and with no change to the current field conditions, BSK8808 diverted to KROC and landed 
without any further incident.

Flight was fueled and arrived KITH with a delay of 2 hours 10 mins. "></attribute>

The joint of one of the wheels is cracked, which causes the whole stair to vibrate when being moved.  The vibration from prolonged use will continue to worsen the crack.

Also, the platform does not go up or down--we are unable to adjust for the height difference between -400 and -800 model, which in turn may cause damage to the aircraft door on the -400.  This also leaves a gap between the airplane and the stair on the -400 model."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="At 1820z left Terminal 3 Gate C31 to taxi A/C to Landmark per ground handling sheets.  Contacted Landmark via radio (122.95) and were told they had no idea we were parking there today and the would have to call someone in to park us at the North Lounge.  Taxied down taxiway K to end to wait for a marshaller.  Waited on Taxiway K till around 1930Z and asked Landmark for an update.  They said we could self park as close to the North Lounge as we were comfortable with on the North side of the ramp.  Taxied to the north side of the ramp and made a right 90 degree turn to the west moving toward the north lounge.  Checked clearance of left wing with GSE (air-stair trucks) through very glazed L3 window and began turning right to park.  Diverted attention to the front of the A/C and the L wing struck the movable partition at the top of the 3 air-stair trucks.  Looked out the L3 window and saw the L wing was in contact with the top of the third air-stair platform and immediately shut down A/C and set parking break. "></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="This event occurred because Landmark was not notified of our arrival by Ground Handling and Landmark did not have enough staff to provide a marshaller. Also, while attempting to self park, I misjudged the clearance of the left wingtip. "></attribute>
                    <attribute name="that_an_event_had_occurred" value="It was determined that this event occurred by visually seeing the left wingtip in contact with the platform of the air-stair truck."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="once_the_event_was_identified" value="Once the it was determined the event occurred, the A/C was shut down, the parking brake was set and the A/C stairs were lowered to assess the damage.  Operations was called and I requested to speak to the duty officer. "></attribute>
                    <attribute name="avoiding_recurrence_of_this_event" value="An event like this can be avoided by making the proper notifications to necessary parties and assuring that a marshaller is available.  In this instant, the A/C should have been shut down, the mechanic let off the A/C to assure that the proper clearance was available operating on a tight ramp."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="I was scheduled for a 0415L show time on 5/18/13.  Capt. Robinson and I were to operate MIA-LIR-IAH 
to be followed by a lengthy layover in IAH.  Total duty was to be 950.  At 1828L on 5/17/13 an updated 
itinerary from Sched. Tapias was sent indicating that in lieu of laying over in IAH, we would be ferrying 
back to MIA for a total scheduled block of 850 and a duty time of 1320.  I saw this at approximately 
2030L as I was getting ready for bed.  I immediately contacted Capt. Robinson and asked if he would 
contact Crew Scheduling and request a crew augmentation due to the longer duty day and early show 
time.  He agreed.  I went to bed at about 2130L and the last time I looked at the clock it was about 
2230L.

Sometime in the night, my phone rang.  I got out of bed assuming it was my alarm.  When I went to 
silence the alarm, I noticed that it was Crew Scheding, specifically, Sched. Pacheco.  The time was 
0158L.  He told me that the a/c was broken and that I should not report as checked for my trip.  He then 
stated that it might go at some point later.  Thinking the delay would be minimal, I told him I would turn 
off my alarm and just wait to hear from him.  I lay back down and tried to sleep.  While at some point I 
did fall asleep, I continually woke up.  I don't believe that for the rest of the night, until finally getting up at 
0615L that I had more than 15 or 20 minutes of uninterrupted sleep followed by the same amount of 
time of being awake.

At 0752L on 5/18/13 an itinerary for a new trip was sent by Sched. Velasquez.  This new trip had a show 
time of 1240L on 5/18/13 and the first duty day ended in ATL at 0130L on 5/19/13 for a total scheduled 
block of 850 and a duty time of 1330.  Based on the fact that effectively I had been awake since 
approximately 0200L after receiving less than 4 hours of sleep, I realized that I would be unsafe to 
operate this trip.  Not wanting to call in Fatigued, I decided to contact scheduling and inform them that I 
believed I'd been placed on this trip in error, as my original trip for which I was checked at 0415L was no 
longer operating and that Scheduling needed to use a pilot from the Short Call list.  They refused.

I indicated to Sched. Velasquez that while I appreciated Sched. Pacheco's call to cancel my 0415L 
showtime and save me from leaving my house, it had interrupted my sleep cycle to the point that I had 
been unable to achieve any meaningful rest after that time.  I again stated that I should be replaced with 
one of the pilots on the Short Call list as that is what it was for and as the shift supervisor, she had the 
authority to do so.  She refused and instructed me to call Capt. Passwater.  

At this point, I decided that there was no reason to speak to anyone else as I realized that the whole 
reason I didn't feel fit for the new trip was that I was fatigued.  Speaking with anyone else wasn't going to 
change that and having remembered the numerous occasions when Capt. Kamrad has vociferously 
stated that &quot;if pilot's are fatigued, they need to call out fatigued&quot;, I elected to do so.

I was fortunate that as I became more alert this morning, I could make a sound judgement call admitting 
that while I might be able to operate from MIA to LIR and potentially even onward to IAH, I would be in 
no position to continue beyond that safely.  I recognize that a Fatigue Call can trigger schedule changes, 
and I am sorry for the inconvenience, but knowing that I could be replaced by a pilot available on the 
Short Call list for a new trip originating in MIA made the decision easier and allowed me to make the 
truly safe choice."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="When a trip sequence changes to the degree that the one above did, the first thing that a Crew 
Scheduler should look at is the Safety of the operation  In order to be prepared for an early AM 
departure most crews will try to adjust their sleep cycle.  Changing that departure can result in the crew 
member not being fit for the new duty period.  Schedulers must recognize this and consider all the 
options available to ensure that the crew that will operate a trip sequence is the safest, most rested they 
can muster. 

Consequentially, one of the first questions that should then be asked of the crew member when trying to 
assign a new trip sequence after interrupting rest is whether or not they are rested and able to safely 
operate the next duty sequence in it's entirety.  Trying to force a trip change on a crew member, 
particularly after they have noted that their rest was compromised when other crew members are 
available is not only inappropriate, but also unsafe."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="I woke up at 8:30 zulu (3:30 L) after being able to get about four hours of sleep.  Scheduled to report at 9:30 zulu (4:30 L) at Miami.  Scheduled to LIMO to FLL at 9:30 zulu (4:30 L), arrive at 10:30 zulu (5:30 L). Scheduled to commercial on US Air at 12:00 zulu (7:00 L) to DCA, arriving into DCA at 14:28 zulu (9:28 L).  Scheduled to commercial from DCA at 18:05 zulu (13:05 L), arriving into CMH at 19:33 zulu (14:33 L). Scheduled to LIMO to hotel for a layover near LCK with a 20:33 zulu (15:33 L) arrival.  Scheduled to layover for 14:17 in LCK for a 10:50 zulu (5:50 L) report time the next morning to operate LCK-YYZ-MIA.
Once arriving into CMH, crew scheduling advised that we would drop off the flight attendants at the hotel in LCK and the pilots would continue to the airport (LCK) to operate an aircraft from LCK-MIA.  Since there had been no live flights, it was considered Part 91 and no 117 rules applied to the pilots.  We waited on a mechanical delay before departing from LCK and arrived/blocked into MIA at 00:55 zulu (7:55 L), and were released at 01:25 zulu (8:25 L).  A 15 hour and 55 minute duty day that started in the middle of the night, with two LIMOs, two oversold commercial flights (one of which had a medical emergency), a lot of waiting around in terminals and FBOs, five airports (MIA-FLL-DCA-CMH-LCK-MIA) and a ferry flight on a Miami Air aircraft."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="If 117 had applied to this duty day, the crew would have had a maximum duty period of 10 hours. (5 hours and 55 minutes less).  I recommend that when giving a crew a report time in the middle of the night (4:30 am local) with limos and commercials all over the place, the crew not then be expected or required to fly an aircraft.  The crew was assigned to operate the aircraft after already being on duty for over twelve hours.  A last minute change like this provides no ability for the crew to attempt to properly rest for such a day.  More direct commercials (reducing the stress and fatigue on pilots and reducing the time spent going from airport to airport to airport) would keep crews fresher and provide more flexibility for the company to make changes when they are required without crews becoming fatigued.  (Example: SouthWest 2645 departs FLL at 11:35 Local arrives into CMH at 14:20 Local.  This commercial as an example would have had a report time of 9:05 Local.  This would have provided a better sleep schedule for the pilots and reduced the duty time for the day).
Until travel (and crew scheduling) begins to consider and look into pilot fatigue and report times in the middle of the night instead of just going with the transportation need that is five dollars cheaper, pilots will continue to be placed into duty days that result in fatigue.  Waiting until the day prior to look for transportation means many options are not available. Waiting until 00:00 zulu (19:00 Local) to confirm/pay for the commercial for the next morning reduces the available seats for crew members to select from often resulting in only middle seats being available which are not comfortable or easily used for resting. Just because it's legal does not mean it is not fatiguing. "></attribute>

            <category name="Narratives">
                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="I was acclimated to Amsterdam, The Netherlands after completing a TDY/trip in AMS for approximately six 
weeks (departed Miami for Amsterdam on July 29th, 2014).  I conducted numerous trips from Amsterdam 
during the TDY throughout Europe.

On September 05th, 2014 I was checked in and reported for an assignment in Amsterdam, The Netherlands 
(AMS) at 10:45am local.  (The transportation from the hotel to the airport left at 10:00am local).  Assignment 
was a Part 91 operation: deadhead from Amsterdam (AMS) to Gander (YQX) to Portsmouth (PSM).  Flight 
times for the two deadhead flights were 5:45 and 2:30 respectively with one hour on the ground in Gander.  
Upon arrival in PSM I would be the operating pilot (PM) for a flight from PSM to MIA, scheduled at 3:20 
block.  Our arrival time in Miami was 7:20pm local, we were released from duty at 7:50pm local.  Scheduled 
duty day was 15:50.  Miami had a six hour time difference from Amsterdam.
The company (crew scheduling) contacted me at approximately 8:33pm local on Sept 5th and placed me on 
a thirty-six (36) hour break starting at 9:00 pm local.  The company said this would acclimate me to the time 
zone again (Miami) and additional rest was not required as per their interpretation of the FAR 117 even 
though I had been more than 4 times zones away during a serious of FDPs for more than 168 hours.  The 
company states that the required 56 hours of rest including three consecutive nights was not applicable.

My company assigned rest period began at 9:00 pm local on Friday, Sept 5th and would end on Sunday, 
Sept 7th at 9:00 am local.  This was intended to be an uninterrupted 36 hour rest period free from all duties.

The company (crew scheduling) made multiple phone calls to my primary contact number during my 
assigned rest period.

First phone call was received on Saturday (6th) at 6:56 pm local.
Second phone call was received on Saturday (6th) at 9:44 pm local.
Third phone call was received on Sunday (7th) at 5:28 am local.

Each phone call was unanswered and the company left a voicemail after each call instructing me to contact 
the company/crew scheduling.  The company assigned a duty during an assigned &quot;rest period&quot; which is 
supposed to be &quot;free from all duty&quot;.  (Duty assigned was to contact the company for a trip assignment and 
receive details about the trip).

The first phone call's voice mail stated: &quot;...contact scheduling, we need to check you in...&quot;
The second phone call's voice mail stated: &quot;...give us a call back&quot;.
The third phone call's voice mail stated: &quot;...give us a call back&quot;.

The clear intent of every phone call's voice mail was for me to return the call and perform the required 
actions to be checked in for a duty assignment.

The multiple phone calls that were received during the assigned rest period, as well as the voice mails 
interrupted my rest.
I contacted the company (crew scheduling), still during my assigned rest period, and advised them that due 
to their continuos phone calls and attempts to contact me, my rest had been interrupted.  I was advised by 
the scheduler that since I had not answered the phone calls, the company did not recognize the phone calls 
as an interruption of rest.  The company also stated that they had a good reason to attempt to call me, they 
were attempting to reach me so that I could be checked-in for my flight that was scheduled to depart on 
September 7th.  The company advised they would look into this and contact me with further instructions once 
the lead scheduler had been spoken to.

The company attempted to call me shortly later (approximately 9:07 am local) but the phone call did not 
connect properly.  I called the company back and spoke to the lead scheduler (approximately at 9:07 am 
local) and she advised me that the company only provided additional rest if a &quot;ten hour period&quot; before an 
FDP was interrupted.  This assigned rest period (36 hour rest period) did not meet that and therefore they 
would not take any action.  I asked t be placed on a new rest period free from all duty and un-interrupted.  
The response was that they don't do that and there was nothing that the company would do in this situation.  
I was informed that if I disagreed with the lack of action from the company, my option was to contact my 
supervisor or my Union representative.  Additionally, they were assigning me to a Short Call assignment 
starting at 11:00 pm local on Sept 7th.
I informed the scheduler that I had not received uninterrupted rest as required by FAR 117 and had notified 
the company as required that morning (still during my 36 hour rest period).  Therefore, since my last 
uninterrupted 30 hour rest period was on September 01, 2014, I was unable to accept any FAR 117 FDP 
assignments until such time that I received a true uninterrupted 30 hour rest period as required (pilot must 
receive a 30 hour break within the last 168 hours in order to accept an assignment).  The company once 
again advised me that there was nothing that they could do and they did not deem the rest period to be 
interrupted and I would have to contact my supervisor or Union official and they would show me checked in 
for my next Short call assignment as scheduled.
During this conversation, a different scheduler also contacted me and left a voice mail that was to inform me 
that I was being checked-in for a short call assignment.

I respectfully once again advised the scheduler that as per FAR 117 I would not be able to accept an 
assignment until such time I received the required rest and would not be fit for duty.  The company violated 
their responsibility to ensure I received uninterrupted rest, and as a result I endured a disruption in my rest.

After speaking to the company/lead crew scheduler, I submitted an email to the Chief Pilot (Captain John 
Passwater) and the Director of Scheduling (Mr Scott Karol) outlining the issue I had encountered with a 
request to correct this situation.  As of the writing of this report, I have not received a response from either.

I understand that the company currently shows me as having completed a 36 hour rest period and as being 
checked in for my next Short Call assignment even though I have advised them that their actions and 
multiple attempts to contact/call me interrupted my rest period and caused additional fatigue.  I did not 
receive the required rest that I was checked in for."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="FAR 117 clearly states that a rest period should be uninterrupted and free from all duty.  The company should 
not make attempts to contact a crew member (via telephone, text, email, etc) during this rest period.  The 
company has no regard for the rest period and when advised of the fatigue issue has no regard to correct the 
situation.  Should the company break this rest period, and be advised by the crew member that there was an 
interruption of rest, the company should reassign the crew member to a rest period to provide the required 
uninterrupted rest period as required by FAR 117.

FAR 117 is clear that the company cannot assign duties or contact the crew members during rest periods.  
The company should review FAR 117 and provide additional training to crew schedulers to ensure that the 
requirements of FAR 117 are met and followed."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="We were completing our preflight duties on the flight deck for BSK 8619, JQF-MDW on 9-11-14. I looked out the right side window and saw 
several passengers cross over the Jersey Barriers separating the car parking area from the sterile area on their way to the screening building. 
Effectively, they elected to take the shortest route to the screening building and in so doing, entered the sterile area around the aircraft prior to 
having their ID's verified or being screened. I was however, able to maintain visual contact with them and ensured that they did not approach 
the aircraft as they passed through this area.

Once they were clear, I exited the flight deck and approached the GSC to discuss it with him. He brought me to the gentleman in the 
screening building and I spoke to him about it. I told them both that it was not acceptable for passengers that had not yet been screened to be 
entering the sterile area and that it was also not appropriate for any passenger to be in any location around the aircraft while unaccompanied 
unless they were approaching the air stairs to board. I was told that this had happened in the past and that the passengers had been told to 
walk to the screening building outside of the sterile areas but that occasionally some still tried to take the shortest route.

I let them both know that we did not feel this was acceptable and that better attention needed to be paid to prevent this happening in future. I 
also told then that I would be following up with Miami Air. Capt. Curtis left a message for Theresa Singleton about this and he and I spoke to 
her on Saturday, 9-12-14 at which point she requested a follow up through the company reporting system.

I would like to note, though, that after speaking to the GSC, I did see him redirect a passenger that attempted to enter the sterile area prior to 
being screened.

&quot;753MA â€“ Aircraft is outside, No safety belt around in order to secure

752MA â€“ Aircraft in hanger, was left without belt attached. Safety belt secured by an employee

[I choose to report this] anonymous as I believe contractors are tired of me asking them to put warning belt at door when doors are left open. 

Side Note: Miami Air Employeeâ€™s are usually good at securing these when working on aircraft. 99% of the time itâ€™s the contractors who leave them unsecured.&quot;"></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Mechanic Lucus told me in PHl that two noses would be in KSHD.and needed to be changed due to cord showing. I called MC who told me 
it's ok until the second cord shows which was not the case. I told him too hold off and wait until we got to SHD and see if we had time. We 
arrived early, I asked if they were already inflated which they were. The wind was blowing up to 20 kts and asked him if this was a good idea 
with that strong a wind. His reply &quot;no problem.&quot;. I SUGGESTED we do it in BGR were we ended up for 20plus hour layover and I told him I 
would help him
With the aircraft jacked up,both tires deflated, and the right nose off as he was putting the new right nose on wind blew and moved the A/C 
because it wasn't chocked right. At no time did he check that the aircraft was chocked properly  The jack shifted to a 20 degree angle wedged 
against the left nose. The jack was wedged against the tire on one corner of the jack.We were lucky it didn't come totally off the jack, hurt him 
and end up with the left deflated Â tire resting on the jack. The Right nose stayed on and he tightened the lock nut. Now he wanted a tow bar. 
At that time I stepped in an made him lower the jack which came down wedged on the rim of the left nose tire. Now the a/c was resting on the 
right nose tire with the jack wedged on the left nose tire rime. He took the nut off the left tire and hammered the tire until it came of and freed 
the jack. Jacked the nose gear up and put the new left nose on. Ron Edmonds witnessed this also. We were lucky.
Mr Lucas doesn't listen to anyone,he's not a team player, and does what he wants.Reality he rushed because he didn't want to change the tire 
in BGR or come out the next day.  So he rushed and as he said that was close it scared me. He all most hurt himself or could have cost Miami 
Air a lot of money.   "></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Upon returning from lunch on 10/07/14, Millie (Pan Am Front Desk) asked if I could help her with a problem they were having.  She stated several Miami Air Employees were smoking in non-designated areas, including the 2nd and 3rd floor balconies (in the stair wells) and the metal door behind the Pan Am Front Desk.  She stated the employees were propping the doors open and, standing just outside of them, smoking.  She stated that she had asked the employees several times to quit and had posted a no-smoking sign on the 1st floor door in an effort to resolve the issue.  She also stated that the smell is carrying thru the open door and into the building.  I have noticed the smoke smell several times as well.  Human Resources Department has sent several messages to Miami Air employees stressing the importance of not propping the doors open and the rules on smoking in designated areas only.   Millie has asked us to do something about the continued problem."></attribute>
                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="My opinion:  The event continues to occur because the employees are either trying to hide their smoking or the amount of smoke breaks taken, or they do not want to walk to the front of the building each time they need a cigarette."></attribute>

Flight 681 MAO EZE I came out to fly this leg. Aircraft came from PAP with Lucas as the mechanic. As I reviewed the log book a fuel audit  
had already been filled out on my blank page as being accomplished. How do you do a fuel audit if your in the van going to the hotel? Â Even 
better I fueled the aircraft and signed the fuel slip. Â Aircraft 733. Log page 243751. So he falsified the log page by saying he did a fuel audit for 
my flight that I fueled while he was in the van going to the hotel.
If he falsifies basic fuel audits, what does he sign off in the log book as a mechanic that he does not accomplish?"></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="The following is a statement from an employee who wishes to remain anonymous.  This employee approached the Sr. Director of Safety and Security on Thursday, November 20th, 2014 with a concern.

&quot;The work environment is continually being interrupted by loud, heated conversations between Joe Roche and Curtis Gravett.  Every morning, Curtis comes to the office to &quot;check-in&quot; with Joe and most mornings they end up in a heated conversation with each other.  This morning, Curtis came in the office and Joe had not come in yet.  Walter asked Curtis a question about the work being completed in the hangar and Curtis stated he had not been to the hangar yet.  Walter was upset with the answer given and said he would take care of this and left.  Several minutes later, Joe came in and accused Curtis of &quot;throwing him under the bus.&quot; Curtis replied that he had only answered the question asked of him.  Once again both Joe and Curtis became loud and abusive in their conversation.  I heard what was asked by Walter and the answer Curtis gave and Curtis, in my opinion, said nothing out of line.  After several minutes of loud conversation with accusations and sarcasm from both, Curtis left.  During this argument no one in the office was working.  They were all focused on the conversation.  I think this has gone on long enough and something needs to be done. &quot; "></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="On October 28th, 2014 Miami Air properly shipped three APU fire bottles to BizJet International Sale and Support, a repair station in Tulsa, OK so that they could be installed on one of our aircraft.  The facility installed the three units we sent and used the same shipping box to return the three APU fire bottles removed from the aircraft.  The previous hazmat labels were covered with a fragile sticker and the paperwork did not reflect that this was a hazmat shipment.  The repair station shipped hazmat items to Miami Air without the proper paperwork and labeling.
Friday, December 12, 2014, at 10:30 am EST, Armando Martinez, MAI's Sr. Director of Safety and Security, who is also MAI's Ethics Compliance Officer, received a call from Mr. Joseph Bernard, a Miami Air Stockroom employee, who had just received a parts shipment (APU fire bottles), notifying him of an apparent Hazmat shipping violation. 

Mr. Martinez immediately went to the stockroom, took pictures of two improperly labeled boxes and gathered a copy of the paperwork that Miami Air used for shipping the original three APU fire bottles.  While he was examining the two boxes, a third improperly labeled box arrived. When the first box was examined, it was noticed that the squibs had been removed.

At 11:50am EST, Mr. Martinez called Ms. Deborah Kennedy at the Southern Region Office in Atlanta, GA to report this event.

In addition to this email, FAA form 5800.1 was submitted via web. Tracking #606975, Report # E-2014120259.

Additional supporting documentation and pictures are attached.

They issued a decent clearance to FL 270 to depart RVSM airspace. 
I notified the company via Airink of the mechanical failure, the new assigned altitude, expected fuel burn and are en-route

A coordinated decision was made between the flight crew, dispatch and MOC that the flight could be completed safely to the

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="On July 14, 2014 at 0130Z, N732MA (BSK514 FERRY FLIGHT) was involved in  a fuel spill while fueling at LANDMARK AVIATION in San 
Diego, California.
Fueler Manny from LANDMARK AVIATION (very experienced on 737 fueling procedures) came up and advised me that fuel from the main 
tank #1 (left wing) overflowed and exited the aircraft via left fuel vent onto the ramp.
As I exited the aircraft, I noticed the 15X15 fuel puddle under the left wingtip/fuel vent.
Fueling was suspended, and LANDMARK AVIATION proceeded to clean up the spill with their solid chemical solution. 
As cleaning was taking place, I proceeded to the fueling station to asses the fueling problem.
As the Fueler resumed fueling the center tank with main tanks valves CLOSED,  the #1 main tank was taking fuel. 
This was a clear indication that the #1 main tank valve failed open, therefore, no auto shutdown feature would be available allowing fuel to 
overflow and spill over.
(I do have video of the tank Receiving fuel with valve switch in the CLOSED position)
In order to accomplished fueling, fuel was transferred from main tank with failed valve in order to fuel the remaining tanks without a 
subsequent spill.
Fueling was successfully accomplished and aircraft and crew departed San Diego to Miami.
Supervisor advised me that LANDMARK AVIATION will DIRECT BILL Miami Air for clean up efforts from the incident.
item was noted in logbook to avoid subsequent spills from N732MA.

  The fueler arrived and was waiting for me to come down and move the work stand. It was positioned in front of the right wing tip so he could not pull up into fueling position.
  I moved the work stand under the wing and watched the driver approach the aircraft. I observed him driving too close to the wing and gave him a hand signal to turn away from the aircraft. I looked at him and he shook his head no. At that point I made an emphatic hand gesture, motioning him away from the wing, at which point he did.
  In over 30 years of working around aircraft, I have never had anyone attempt to or defy a directive while marshaling them around an aircraft. This was a first. I am not happy about this. I gave this driver a directive to move away from the aircraft and he tells me no. This is a serious safety issue.
  This is very disconcerting that a driver would deliberately defy my direction and jeopardize my safety as well as those around me. Not to mention the potential damage to my aircraft."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="During the arrival into KLAF, we received a RA-climb command.  We had received a clearance from GRISSOM Approach to descend to 
3,000'.  We were approximately 8 miles northwest of the airport.  GRISSOM pointed out the position of the airport, and we requested a visual 
for a right downwind RWY28.  Approach cleared us for a visual RWY28 and to contact Lafayette tower.  Lafayette tower advised us of VFR 
traffic at 2500',12 o'clock. At that time we were at +/-4000' descending when we received a RA-climb.  Additional VFR traffic was at 3500', we 
climbed to 4200' having traffic insight leveled off. Told the tower we had a RA.  We continued the approach and landed at Lafayette with no 
additional incident.

I called the tower via cell phone to discuss the RA. I was informed they do not have radar.  Therefore, heighten awareness while flying into 
class D, non-radar towers is crucial.

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="Parties involved include  the Senior dispatcher Alaric Brown, Catalina Diaz, and Mike Shin. 
The event occurred over KADW just after the turnover, so around 3:15 pm 
Pilots involved was Capt Wayne Smith with Aircraft 753MA

Per request of Senior Dispatcher on duty, I was given the task of filling out the WBAT. The flight follower program that we 
dispatchers usually use was down. Morning shift emailed the MIS person on duty but was not able to get any action. I 
later then called the MIS duty person for another computer reason (my programs were not installed on the back computer 
which made it hard to function) and asked him if there was anything they could do but to no avail. We were doing our duty 
monitoring the flights as best we could. Everything seemed ok as flights were dispatched with legal wx. About 15 min after 
the turnover between morning and afternoon shift, we got a call from Capt Wayne that he landed in PIT and needed the 
information for Atlantic Aviation as he diverted to PIT due to wx over ADW. He held over ADW as much as he could but 
had to divert to PIT before his fuel became critical. He was on the 400 so he did not have a Satphone to communicate 
with us readily "></attribute>

soon as they assess the situation. At 11:55z he called me back and said they have 2 nurses taking care of the lady and requested permission 
to open the first aide and medical kit. I said &quot;yes&quot; and let me know what the nurses find out.  Shortly after that he called again saying the lady 
was 52 years old and had low blood pressure 90/60, they had started her on O2.  At that time PR Brown requested to enter the flight deck.  
She said the lady's blood pressure is now 110/70 and her blood sugar was 7.0. I asked if the nurses thought is was necessary to land as soon 
as possible.  At that time we only had 0:40-45min. left to AMS. We declared a medical emergency and continued to AMS. Believing that would 
be the quickest time to get medical treatment for the passenger. We arrived at gate G07 in AMS at 12:45z with the paramedics waiting for us."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="  08-14-15 began with an1100Z flight from JQF.  A 0900Z show time.  JQF-CMH-AEX-ALO, arrived in ALO at 1920Z.  Sat in ALO for 4 hours then ferried 733 to ANC to replace 732.  Arrived in ANC at 0540Z.  A 20 hour 40 minute day.  We got to the hotel and I was finally able to sleep.  
  After 6:30 of sleep, I received a phone call from Maintenance Control, 1325Z or 0525L,   &quot;Luis Berrios is on his flight from ORD-ANC, get out and start taking 732 apart so we can get this plane fixed&quot;.  I got up, dressed, packed up and went down and had breakfast.  I checked out of the hotel and went out to repair 732.
  Luis and I got the plane fixed and ready for a 0300Z, 2100L departure.  15 hours and 35 minutes after my wake up.  At approximately 1300L it started to rain.  It rained off and on for the rest of the day.  After the repair was complete and an engine run for a leak check, the cowlings had to be closed.  I laid under the engine to close the C-Cowls and main engine cowling.  Now I'm soaking wet from head to toe on my back.  Wet ramp.
  We closed up everything, put the tools away, returned borrowed tools to Pegasus Aviation and I boarded the plane for a Ferry to YIP.  I changed my clothes in flight. A 6.5 hour flight from ANC-YIP, 1210Z arrival.  I secured 732 and went to hotel. A 22 hour and 45 minute day.
  On arrival at the hotel on Sunday, 08-16-15, I was told that our reservations were for 08-15-15 and since we did not check in, our reservations were cancelled.  The Crew rooms were re-booked, but mine was not.  Since mine was not, I had no room.  I had to wait for a room to be available and cleaned before I could get a room.  2 hours later I got a room.  3 hours of sleep and I'm back out on 732 to do a PT before we go to JQF.  A scheduled 2230Z departure.  We were late.  We left at 0030Z, 08-17-05.  
  On arrival in JQF, I called the hotel and find out that my reservation was for 08-16-15.  Cancelled again.  I called Crew Scheduling and they re-booked my room at the Hyatt Place CLT.  So I limo'd to the hotel.  I arrived at 0000L.
  After 2 hours of sleep, I woke up for my commercial home.  I tried to check in on-line. There is a problem, I must call the airline, Delta.  Once again my flight reservation was for 08-16-15, not 08-17.  It was cancelled.  I had to pay a $50.00 re-booking fee.  My flight was re-booked and I was on my way home.

it appeared to be closed correctly- no gaps closed easily.  The flight deck door light extinguished. We took off from RWY02 cleared to 8,000'. 
At 4,000' the &quot;after take-off checklist&quot; was accomplished, noticing the cabin climbing +1,200 fpm. We received additional climb clearance to 
16,000'. The cabin was still climbing +1,200fpm, we leveled off at 10,600'.  I called the purser and asked if the L-1 door was leaking. She 
replied it was noisy. I asked her to open the flight deck door, the L-1 door was unusually loud. Therefore we returned to JQF. Landed on 
RWY20 and taxied to the ramp. The L-1 door was jammed, unable to be opened. Logbook entry was made and maintenance notified.

50 minutes delay caused by catering. Late arrival to airplane at gate, then only dropped off the food in the jetway. Could not get approved for F/A's to cater so Delta ground handlers catered the airplane. Also caterer shorted us on passengers meals, only 158 for 166 pax. Used crew meals for passengers.

Did not notify crew of late aircraft arrival. Both Dispatch and Scheduling knew about delay. Also had to call Duty Officer to get travel to extend hotel rooms for late check out. Captain had to find rooms and arrange transportation in JQF. Not done by travel.

                    <attribute name="occurred,_and_who_was_involved" value="     On 8/25/14, I flew Milwaukee  (MKE) to Gander, New Foundland (YQX) and then on to Gronningen, 
Netherlands (GRQ).   It was a ferry flight with only 2 pilots-- no flight attendants and no opportunity to rest.     
Our showtime in MKE was 3pm (2000Z) and we arrived in the Netherlands at 10 am local (0800z) on 8/26 
(Total flight time 9 hours).   It was almost another hour after our block in by the time we arrived at the hotel.   
With our &quot;back side of the clock&quot; schedule and no relief pilot, I got no sleep that night. 

        The next day (8/27) , I did  a live  Etops flight with just 2 pilots.    We showed at 700Z (0900L).  This 
time we returned to YQX after 5:55 flight time.    We blocked in at 1455 Z (1225L).     Then, while still in 
uniform,  we sat in a passenger seat during a revenue flight back to Miami.       The block time was 5:00  
and we arrived at 2105Z (1705L).   It took more than an hour to clear customs/immigration and arrive in 
the van back to the parking lot.     

        I was told I was on short call the next day.    When I woke up, I still felt exhausted and I advised crew 
scheduling of my condition.  

       I believe that 2 atlantic crossing in a couple days is enough to make anyone fatigued.   In the interest 
of safety, it is better that I rest until felling better.

           Scheduling needs to be concerned about the previous duty performed by pilots and understand that 
pilot fatigue is dangerous.    They need to go beyond looking at simply whether an assignment is legal.     "></attribute>

item in the check list was called, I looked at the instrument and noticed the flap position indicator pointing at 1 with a split needle, this was 
confirmed almost at the same time by First Officer Mendoza, I looked back outside toward the runway and asked FO Mendoza to confirm what 
I just saw, he stated again that the position indicator was pointing at 1 with a split needle, I took a final look and right after I stated I'M GOING 
AROUND, at that exact moment during the transition from approach to go around the warning TOO LOW FLAPS sounded, flew the go around 
and reported to the tower that I have a non normal indication and I needed to run a check list before attempting another approach, tower 
instructed us to fly to SOUTP and hold, I made a PA announcement to the passengers then I gave the Purser the &quot;NTSB&quot;, we run the 
TRAILING EDGE FLAP ASYMMETRY non normal check list, double check the performance, and set up for another approach, the second 
approach and landing was uneventful."></attribute>

                    <attribute name="observation_comments" value="On the morning of 02-19-16 I was working aircraft N738MA.
The fueler arrived and was waiting for me to come down and move
the work stand. It was positioned in front of the right wing tip so he
could not pull up into fueling position.
I moved the work stand under the wing and watched the driver
approach the aircraft. I observed him driving too close to the wing
and gave him a hand signal to turn away from the aircraft. I looked
at him and he shook his head no. At that point I made an emphatic
hand gesture, motioning him away from the wing, at which point
he did.
In over 30 years of working around aircraft, I have never had
anyone attempt to or defy a directive while marshaling them
around an aircraft. This was a first. I am not happy about this. I
gave this driver a directive to move away from the aircraft and he
tells me no. This is a serious safety issue.
This is very disconcerting that a driver would deliberately defy my
direction and jeopardize my safety as well as those around me. Not
to mention the potential damage to my aircraft.

I do not know why this fueler ignored my directive. He was within
three feet of the leading edge of the wing. I did not want a 10000
gallon fuel truck that close to my wing. He wanted to pull close to
the wing and drive forward to the engine, then turn forward to the
front of the aircraft. I guess this gets him closer to the wing so he
does not have to drag the hose as far.

As soon as the fueling event was complete, I spoke with the Agent
at NGU: Crystal Wikoff. She informed me that she would be
contacting the Manager in charge of the fueler to see what is to be
done.
When I returned to NGU at 1900L, I again spoke with Crystal. She
said that the manager wanted me to write up a report as to what
happened, so that they have documented proof as to what
happened.
I wrote up a report and emailed it to Crystall last night (02-22-16).
She informed me today (02-23-16) that she printed out my report
and turned it in along with my phone number and email address.
The narrative above is the report I sent."></attribute>

I was not able to be downstairs immediately.  When I did get down to put the locks and covers on, I noticed that they were not using a belt loader to off load the forward bin.  They use a large wooden box to put the bags in, then they use a forklift to move the box around.  They put the box up close to the aircraft to load and unload bags.  
This is how they damaged one of our -400's in the past.  They moved the box and it struck the fuselage.  
They have been advised since that incident to use a belt loader."></attribute>

Despite a 3 pilot crew assignment to reduce the total flight hours for the CLT-LAS-CLT flights on 02MAR16 thru 03MAR16, our next nights' flights were still scheduled in excess of 9 hours total flight time within the 24 hour consecutive period. The Actual total flight time came to 9 hours 28 minutes.

At around 0250z on 04MAR16 while in flight I became extremely fatigued.

Each new flight day we were scheduled for and conducted operations at earlier than the next day's Hotel Lobby report time. Each Report at the aircraft FDP start time ( a later time than show time) was also scheduled for and conducted at an earlier than the next days' FDP start time.

Here they were again in short:

01MAR16 local times
Hotel Lobby: 2045
FDP start: 2100
Hotel Return: 0325 next day

02MAR16 local times
Hotel Lobby: 1400
FDP start: 1430
Hotel Return: 0220 next day

03MAR16 local times
Hotel Lobby: 1230
FDP start: 1300
Hotel Return: 2245 (different time zone) effectively 2345

                    <attribute name="outlining_why_the_event_occurred" value="Recommend the company consider back side of the clock flying 3 nights in a row with reduced rest each subsequent night. The schedule was brutal on the pilot body.

Another factor to consider is that the Hotel in Charlotte did not have room service. With two overnights after back side flying and day resting, pilot crews have to steal from one's sleep to go out to eat between flights or take away mealtime to remain in one's room to prevent loss of sleep.

FAR 121.505 permits the company to fly a pilot greater than 8 hours within a 24 hour consecutive period PROVIDED an intervening rest period at or before the end of the 8 hours of scheduled flight. In our case the company scheduled us for over 9 hours within a 24 hour consecutive period on the last night.
The caveat here is that the company needed to move us to home base immediately after this and as such there is no violation but in essence our pilot bodies did not get twice the hours flown in rest before the commercial travel on the very next day. As such I fell ill upon my return home.
It appears that I was flying that last night's event on pure adrenaline alone.

Respectfully,
Patrick Keane
